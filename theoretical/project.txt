It’s not clear if many of the Framers read closely the work of Machiavelli, often referred to as the first writer in the field of modern political thought, but if they had, they would have rejected his ideas about the acquisition of power and the principles of governance. Machiavelli taught that those seeking power—those seeking to be the Prince—should be guided by the ethic of power and success—“the ends justify the means.” All means of seizing and keeping power—lying, violence, murder—were countenanced, for what mattered to the Prince, was keeping and wielding power to serve his agenda.

Manifestly, the Framers of the Constitution, in creating an executive subordinate to the rule of law, would have found in Machiavelli’s plan the antithesis of the presidency that they invented, an office fenced in by constitutional limits, guided by the principles of republicanism, and bound to the requirements and duties of the “Take Care Clause.” Machiavelli did, however, contribute the concept of a secular, rather than a religious executive. Certainly that idea, if the Framers had somehow learned of it from Machiavelli, would have had appeal to them. After all, the Founders rejected the concept of a monarchy, including a religious monarchy, as seen in their prohibition of religious tests for those seeking office. What’s more, the 1st Amendment’s Establishment Clause represented a powerful repudiation of state support for religion and an affirmation of the separation of church and state. Interestingly, Machiavelli argued for separation of religion and politics, principally on the ground that the former corrupted the latter.

Coke (pronounced “cook”), served on England’s highest courts. He was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas from 1606 to 1613, and of the King’s Bench from 1613 until his antagonist, King James I, dismissed him three years later. He was, moreover, a prolific writer, including the four volumes of Institutes of the Lawes of England, and 13 volumes of Reports, in which he systematized the principles of English law by reporting precedents and cases. The final two volumes of the Reports, focused on the prerogatives of the Crown. Among legal scholars, Coke was the poster boy for law and liberty. He was, for the American founders, a titan.  Coke’s flirtations with judicial review in Dr. Bonham’s Case (1610), fired the imagination of James Otis in the famous Writs of Assistance Case (1761), where he foreshadowed the American doctrine of judicial review and lit the way for separation of powers. And his fundamental—and bold and certainly courageous—assertion that the King of England was subordinate to the law, and bound by interpretations rendered by common law judges whom, it so happened, were the only figures with the capacity of comprehending the mysteries of the ancient constitution were inspirational to American founders.

The introduction of principles of separation of powers into the discussion about governmental organization and authority marked a turning point in the consideration of executive power. Above all, it undercut and, eventually, demolished the concept of absolute monarchical authority.  John Locke’s renowned work, The Second Treatise of Government (1691), proved extremely helpful to American colonists in explaining and defending the rationale for the revolution. Locke’s assertion of the right of revolution, when government grows tyrannical, synthesized the arguments of his intellectual predecessors who, during the English Civil Wars of the mid-17th century, emphasized as a cornerstone of governmental legitimacy the concept of popular consent. A ruling regime that lacked the consent of the people, Locke argued, was illegitimate. Thomas Jefferson drew on that concept in writing the Declaration of Independence, and government grounded in the consent of the citizenry became the sheet anchor of American republicanism.     The seminal idea provided the justification for the drafting and ratification of the Constitution, as manifested in the majestic language of the Preamble to the Constitution: “We the People ... do ordain and establish this Constitution.” The premise that governmental power is derived from the Constitution—and constrained by it—represented the implementation of government based on the consent of the people. That includes, of course, the limits on executive power.

His warning that the accumulation of all governmental powers in a single department would constitute the very definition of tyranny, assumed biblical status in the debates in Philadelphia and across the land. Madison was among Montesquieu’s greatest admirers and, indeed, publicly proclaimed him an oracle on the principle of separation of powers.   The roots of the doctrine of separation of powers could be seen in the Aristotelian idea of mixed government, a concept that provided representation for the various classes of society—royalty, aristocracy, and the common people. The aim was balance, which, Aristotle believed, would maintain stability and preclude revolution. In England, the emergence of the separation of powers occurred as a result of the Civil War, which destroyed the idea of the Divine Right of Kingship and introduced in both the practical and theoretical realms, the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Parliament asserted its governing authority when it required William and Mary to sign the Declaration of Rights in 1689, before they were crowned. Montesquieu, in Chapter 11 of The Spirit of the Laws, asserted that the judicial power should be separate from the executive power, as it was in England. The Framers of the Constitution heightened the status of the judiciary and made it a truly coordinate branch of government when they vested in the courts the authority of judicial review.

But its utility was limited; the colonists were seeking a tool, an explanation, for the authority to create government in the first place. Hobbes’ assumed the existence of government. It was John Locke’s version of the Social Contract that proved enormously useful to the colonists, for Locke posited the right to create government, out of the void of the State of Nature, as it were. The right of the people to actually create government, meant that the people could determine the authority of government, including that of the executive and, critically, the right of the people to impose what would become constitutional limitations on governmental power.

The stark lessons about executive power drawn from the history of monarchies are demonstrable and may be distilled in the words of James Wilson, who told his fellow delegates at the Constitutional Convention: “The prerogative powers of the British King” are “no guide to the powers” of the American presidency. Indeed, during the Founding Era, as the political scientist, Robert Scigliano rightly observed, one of the salient means of tainting a political opponent was to label him as an advocate of prerogative powers. Such a label was deeply wounding and toxic to one’s political career. Accordingly, there arose a need for a new term to describe those powers wielded by an executive in a republican era. That need was filled through the invention of a new term of art: executive power. Seldom has a generation been so fearful of a political association. Perhaps only Americans accused of being “communists” or “communist sympathizers” in the Cold War period at the height of McCarthyism could well appreciate the utilization of “advocate of prerogatives” as such a deadly shaft.

Since the 13th century, English legal scholars had been writing about the dimensions of the monarchical prerogatives. For roughly two centuries, the literary conception of the prerogative power was divided into two realms. On one hand, the prerogative was absolute and unrestrained when either domestic order was threatened or the defense of the realm was at stake. On the other, when the life, liberty, and property of free subjects were at stake, the King was subject to the law of the land.  The royal prerogative mushroomed in scope and power in the 16th century under the Tudor monarchs, particularly under Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The expansion occurred in municipal affairs, for example, when the monarch asserted a dispensing power to regulate commerce and to grant monopolies of trade. The dispensing authority  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_143","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_143","title":"essentially empowered the crown to dispense with the execution of particular laws in particular cases. The expansion also occurred through the introduction of two new prerogatives. The first was monarchical resort to the issuance of royal proclamations that had the force of law. The second involved the creation of prerogative courts, in which the monarch and his council participated directly, and in which accused parties were denied the procedural protections afforded in the common law courts.  The aggrandizement of power by the Tudors, and the repeated assertions of absolute power under the Stuart monarchs in the 17th century, took the prerogative to new heights. This combination plunged England into a century of constitutional crises, the essence of which pitted prerogative powers against Parliament and the common law courts. It was manifested in the usurpation of parliamentary authority to make laws and spend money, circumvention of Parliament when it refused to fund wars by seeking revenue from private persons and foreign governments and, among other acts, removal of judges who failed to adhere to the King’s desires, which denied the possibility of judicial independence. It led, eventually, to Civil War and most dramatically, to the beheading of King Charles I.

The president was made Commander in Chief, but unlike the King of England, he had no authority to declare war. The Framers, moreover, withheld from the president unilateral authority to make and conduct foreign policy. The president was the recipient of the power to receive ambassadors, but that was a clerk-like duty, devoid of discretion, a duty performed in most countries by ceremonial leaders. The treaty power, like the authority to appoint ambassadors, unilaterally exercised in England by the King, was divided between the president and the Senate.

When London began to insist on more direct rule over the colonies in the middle of the 18th century, mainly for reasons of European geopolitics, those governors became very intrusive presences on American soil, charged with executing taxation and mercantilist policies that provoked revolution. The colonial sentiments against the executive were given force in the early state constitutions, which reduced the power of governors to mere symbols and severed all roots to the royal prerogative. James Madison rightly stated that the state executives “are in general little more than Cyphers.” The pervasive distrust of the executive led the Continental Congress, in their drafting of the Articles of Confederation, to dispense with an executive branch.

What emerges is that the various early state constitutions denied to their governors those prerogatives relative to legislation. There was, of course, no dispensing or suspending power. There was, moreover, no authority to convene, prorogue, or dissolve the legislature. Nor was there a veto power. The exercise of executive functions was closely tied to the advice of a council of state, which was selected by state legislatures. The governing documents did embrace the separation of powers which, manifestly, limited the power of the governors. The deep-seated opposition to executive power was captured by James Madison in Federalist No. 48: “The founders of our republics . . . seem never for a moment to have turned their eyes from the overgrown and all-grasping  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_157","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_157","title":"prerogative of an hereditary, supported and fortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative authority.”  But the prescient Madison observed in the same Federalist essay the limited vision that hampered some constitution makers: “They seem never to have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations, which, by assembling all power in the same hands, must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations.”   The Virginia Constitution of 1776 illuminated the concerns about the executive. There, it was provided that “executive powers of government” were to be exercised “according to the laws “ of the Commonwealth. It was emphatic in its repudiation of the prerogative: no power or prerogative could ever be asserted “by virtue of any law, statute, or custom of England.” Virginia had effectively cut off the concept of executive power from the English tradition, including its constitutional practices and the common law, and subjected it to legislative definition.

The New York Constitution of 1777, for example, provided for the election of the Governor by freeholders, rather than selection by the legislature. The Governor was elected to a three-year term and was eligible for reelection. He could exercise, in conjunction with a Council of Revision, a veto over legislation he thought “inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution or with the public good.”   In New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont, the Governor was required to faithfully execute the laws. The Governor, moreover, was Commander in Chief of the militia, although legislatures made the appointments and promotions to military office. But the shortcomings of executive power, if we may call them that, did not tempt any of the states to even flirt with a prerogative power or broad executive discretion, as Thomas Jefferson explained in 1783 in his “Draft of a Fundamental Constitution for Virginia.” Jefferson stated: “By executive powers we mean no reference to those powers exercised under our former government by the crown as of it’s prerogative... We give him those powers only which are necessary to carry into execution the laws...”  That was the foundation for the Virginia Plan— introduced by Governor Edmund Randolph to his colleagues in the Constitutional Convention—which called for the creation of an executive to administer laws and make appointments to office in cases not provide by law.

The states, it will be emphasized, dispensed with the creation of an executive altogether, a decision that reflected the deep concerns about executive power that resonated throughout the nation. The lack of an appetite for an executive was reflected in the specific rejection in 1777 by the Continental Congress of the “Dickinson Draft,” which proposed a plan for an executive. The plan would have created a “Council of State” appointed by Congress that would manage “the general affairs of the United States.” The Council would sit while Congress was in session and continue during its recesses, exercising broad powers: command of the military, administration of finances and diplomacy, and “the execution of such Measures as may be resolved on by the United States.”   The weak Articles of Confederation left government operations to ad hoc or standing committees of Congress, supplemented by boards operating under their direction. But the effort by Congress to “play the executive,” as Alexander Hamilton noted, was ineffective and doomed from the start. The Framers of the Constitution found nothing of appeal in the concept of a government without an executive, and moved, as we have seen in the introduction of the Virginia Plan, to correct that mistake in their invention of the American presidency.

Duration, he argued in Federalist No. 71 and Federalist No. 72, was achieved by the Framers’ structure of the office of the presidency—a four-year term and the opportunity for re-eligibility.   In Federalist No. 73, Hamilton defended a presidential salary to be determined upon assumption to the office but beyond increase or diminution by Congress during his presidency, as a means of protecting the independence of the executive who might otherwise be forced to bend to the will of Congress. As Hamilton rightly pointed out, those who have control of a person’s salary have control “over his will.” As for the basic justification for a presidential salary, Hamilton further noted that public service seldom brings fame or glory; thus, compensation for service is office is required and just.

In Federalist No. 67, Hamilton stated: “Calculating upon the aversion of the people to monarchy,” opponents of the Constitution “have endeavored to enlist their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the intended President . . . as the full-grown progeny of that detested parent.” As a means of allaying those concerns, he engaged in a detailed analysis in Federalist No. 69 of each of the president’s enumerated powers, sharply contrasting them with those powers wielded by the King of England. The Commander in Chief, for example, was merely to be “first General.” Generals are not authorized to commence wars, he explained. Indeed, unlike the British King, who had the authority to take his nation to war, that power, under the Constitution, was vested solely and exclusively in Congress.

The “Antis,” as they were known, sought to exploit the pervasive fear of “executive power” that resonated since the colonial period. As it happened, however, with only a few exceptions, their arguments lacked substance and reasoning. More than anything, they were shafts of derision, delivered against the executive as a means of trying to gin up enough opposition to defeat the proposed Constitution.  It has been observed that those who have studied the Antifederalist writings have paid too little attention to foreign policy or war powers, largely because the Antifederalists had little of substance or disagreement to offer on those subjects. In fact, they and the Federalists shared a consensus on the meaning of the text in those areas. If the Antifederalists had thought that the Constitution was designed to make the president the dominant organ of American foreign policy, that design would have become a major focal point of Antifederalist opposition. But the blueprint for the conduct of foreign affairs afforded little reason for criticism. After all, Congress, not the president, was vested with the war power. And the understanding that the authority to “declare” war was a synonym for “determining” on matters of war and peace, precluded the sort of assertions advanced by advocates of unilateral presidential war-making power that while Congress might announce war, it was nonetheless the president who would make that fundamental decision. Such a position would have mirrored the authority of the British King, a proposition unacceptable to the Framers, whether Federalist or Antifederalist.

The Antifederalists’ criticisms of the presidency ranged broadly, befitting an effort to derail the proposed Constitution. Of course, the predictions in the Federalist papers of how the Constitution would work in practice were always open to criticism since they were not in theory demonstrable. The presidential veto was vulnerable to argument that the judgment of a single person should be exalted above that of Congress, which reflected thoughtful discussion and debate. But even that criticism supported the Federalist design of the Constitution, which as we shall see, favored collective decision-making as opposed to unilateral decision making. And when the veto was understood as a check on the legislature, as well as being subject to an override by a Congress confident in its judgment, the criticism lost much of its merit, especially since all in the founding generation had been aware of the tendency of the legislature, as Madison described it, to draw into its “impetuous vortex,” powers assigned to other branches.

The president, it was said, might through the treaty power sell out the nation. But those criticisms failed to grasp the fact that the appointment and treaty powers were shared with the Senate.   The shared power over appointments and treaty-making gave rise to George Mason’s contention that the president would become a “tool of the Senate.” Indeed, several Antifederalists actually complained that the president was too “weak,” undercutting arguments by other Antifederalists that the president was too strong. Of course, as an opposition party, the Antifederalists were not obliged to be consistent in their attacks on the design of the executive. They might have felt such pressure if the ratification vote in the various states had been a test of every single provision of the proposed Constitution, rather than an up or down vote on the entire document.  Mason’s opposition to the presidency, grounded in the fear that the Senate would dominate the president, was shared by Edmund Randolph and Elbridge Gerry. All three had been delegates to the Convention, but refused to sign the Constitution and campaigned against its ratification. Mason proposed the creation of a six-person council that would serve to reinforce the authority and independence of the president. But this emphasis, once again, laid bare the shared consensus of the Federalists and the Antifederalists on the principle of executive independence from Congress.

The disproportionate allocation of authority between the two branches was explained and justified in James Madison’s famous statement in Federalist No. 51: “In a republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates.” The nature and form of the republic that the Framers were creating certainly did influence the constitutional distribution of powers. History—the Founders’ history—played an important role as well. Professor Louis Henkin has illuminated this experience:   “Unhappy memories of royal prerogative, fear of tyranny, and distrust of any one man, kept the Framers from giving the President too much head...  In the end and over-all, Congress clearly came first, in the longest article, expressly conferring many, important powers; the Executive came second, principally as executive-agent of Congressional policy.

If such a power is, by some means, attributed to the president, it is applied by some means other than enumeration, for the text says nothing about such authority.

Again, setting aside until the next session the question of whether the Executive Power Clause embodies a presidential prerogative, we may say that the provision refers to what the Framers agreed it meant: the executive power, as James Wilson and James Madison observed, is the power to faithfully execute the laws and make appointments to office not otherwise provided for by law.

The concept of executive prerogative plumbs the depths of Anglo-American legal history; it has absorbed the energy and wits of scholars and statesmen across the decades, from the American Revolution and the Constitutional Convention to the Civil War and the Cold War. It has assumed a new urgency in the context of an ill-defined and indeterminate War on Terror, in which presidents assert unilateral powers that are coterminous with the emergencies that they perceive.      Advocates of broad executive powers have sought rationales in assertions of national security, necessity, and emergency. On various occasions, they have invoked the Framers of the Constitution whom, they maintain, clothed the president with a Lockean Prerogative to meet national security crises. That premise, destined to become a staple of teaching and writing on the American presidency, was first asserted by Professor Edward Corwin who, in his influential book, The President: Office and Powers (1940), drew a connection between Locke and the Framers. Corwin first quoted Locke’s famous statement, set forth in the chapter, “Of Prerogative,” in the Second Treatise of Government, published in 1690, that prerogative was the “Power to act according to discretion, for the publick good, without prescription of the Law and sometimes even against it.” Corwin proceeded to claim that “what the Framers had in mind” was “a broad range of autonomous executive power or ‘prerogative.’” Corwin’s contention that the Framers had embraced the literary concept of the Lockean Prerogative, which included the authority to set aside laws, assumed the status of convention among political scientists, historians and lawyers.

We may ask, does the Constitution confer upon the president authority to violate the law? If so, does it derive from the Vesting Clause or the Take Care Clause of Article II? Is there, indeed, room in the Constitution for the president to defy the instrument from which she derives her authority? Is it permissible for the president to swear an oath to uphold the Constitution and, at the same time, to ignore its provisions? That, precisely, is the threshold question raised by the assertion of executive prerogative.  Proponents of an executive prerogative power have sought, primarily, to ground presidential prerogative in the Vesting Clause of Article II, which states that, “the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” Julius Goebel, a renowned legal historian, observed in 1954, that the word, executive, as a “noun . . . was not then a word of art in English law—above all it was not so in reference to the crown. It had become a word of art in various state constitutions adopted from 1776 onward.” “It reflected,” he wrote, the revolutionary response to the situation precipitated by the repudiation of the royal prerogative.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_125","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_125","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24289","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24314","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_126","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_126","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24368","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24393","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_386","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_386","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_387","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_387","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_367","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_367","title":"The First Inauguration of George Washington.

The Virginia Plan provided for a national executive “with power to carry into execution the national laws,” and the power to “appoint to offices in cases not otherwise provided for.” James Wilson, second in importance only to James Madison, as an architect of the Constitution, echoed that understanding, which prevailed throughout the Philadelphia Convention. He declared that executive power was limited to “executing the laws and appointing officers.” Madison agreed and then contributed a principle that proved vital to the construction of presidential power. He thought it necessary “to fix the extent of executive authority,” since “certain powers were in their nature Executive, and must be given to that department.” He added that “a definition of their extent would assist the judgment in determining how far they might be entrusted to a single officer.”   ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_127","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_127","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24447","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24472","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_128","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_128","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24526","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24551","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_388","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_388","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_368","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_368","title":"Ed Meese.

In his own “plan” for a Constitution, which amounted to ideas that he would contribute to Edmund Randolph’s proposals, which were submitted as the Virginia Plan, Hamilton embraced an executive that reflected Wilson’s views. The executive, he stated, would have responsibility for “the execution of all laws passed.” The president, moreover, would be required to obtain the Senate’s approval for making treaties and appointing ambassadors. Hamilton preferred a presidential pardon power weaker than the design that ultimately prevailed, for he would prohibit the president issuing pardons in cases of treason without the approbation of the Senate. In another rebuke to the monarchical model, Hamilton would vest in the Senate “the sole power of declaring war.” In the end, Hamilton’s conception of executive power mirrored the views of presidential power advanced by such heavyweights as James Madison and James Wilson.  The confined nature of the presidency, a conception rooted, for example, in Wilson’s observation that the president is expected to execute the laws and make appointments to office, or in Roger Sherman’s remarks that “he considered the Executive magistracy as nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the Legislature into effect,” represented a characterization that was never challenged throughout the Constitutional Convention. No delegate to the Convention, it is to be emphasized, advanced a theory of presidential prerogative. James Madison justly remarked: “The natural province of the executive magistrate is to execute laws, as that of the legislature is to make laws. All his acts, therefore, properly executive, must presuppose the existence of the laws to be executed.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_133","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_133","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24921","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24946","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_134","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_134","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si25000","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si25025","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_392","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_392","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_393","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_393","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_369","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_369","title":"The U.S. Embassy in Kiev.

That was no mean question for a generation that, more than once, had faced devastation on the battlefield at the hands of an invading empire. Indeed, the prospect of an invasion informed their decision to permit the suspension of habeas corpus. As Justice Robert H.

The British scholar, Lord Dicey, explained in 1885 the rationale that lay behind the approach: “There are times of tumult or invasion when for the sake of legality itself the rules of law must be broken. The course which the government must then take is clear. The Ministry must break the law and trust for protection to an Act of Indemnity.” This mechanism had clear application in the United States. If the president perceived an emergency, he might act extra-constitutionally and seek ratification of his actions from Congress. Ratification would hinge on the question of whether Congress shared the president’s perception of emergency. The principal virtue of this method lay in the fact that it left to Congress, the nation’s chief lawmaking body, the ultimate authority to determine the existence of an emergency. Of course, it also denied to the president the opportunity to be the judge of his own cause, a principle of fundamental importance in Anglo-American legal history. Lucius Wilmerding drew the measure of the doctrine to the enterprise of constitutionalism. He observed: “For if the President is the judge of the necessity, his power is unlimited; he may apply his discretion to any instance whatever.” Of course, the problem with an unwritten doctrine is that there are endless questions about its deployment in practice.  Who decides when it’s ok for a president to act now and ask for forgiveness later? Who decides when Congress is invited to approve? What happens if Congress decides not to approve? And is tacit approval enough, or does there have to be a formal act of approval? There may not be accepted answers to these questions, but history has well settled questions about supremacy in a time of crisis—in favor of the president.

Since exoneration by Congress was contingent upon a shared understanding about the existence of an emergency, executives would be slow to risk their fate and fortune without considerable confidence that the legislature would view the president’s extralegal act as an indispensable necessity. The principle of retroactive ratification, moreover, incorporates elements of the doctrine of separation of powers and checks and balances. As a consequence, it maintains a semblance of constitutional government. The doctrine enjoyed broad support among the Founders.   The rich historical practice of retroactive ratification in America was illustrated in the early days of the republic, including an episode during the Revolutionary War. Virginia Governor Nelson thought it necessary to exceed his authority for the purpose of issuing warrants and impressing supplies. Nelson’s acts were widely regarded as illegal but necessary. The legislature agreed and indemnified Nelson through the passage of retroactive legislation.   In 1793, Alexander Hamilton, then serving as Secretary of Treasury, was the subject of a House resolution that charged him with violation of appropriations statutes. Hamilton denied any wrongdoing and was exonerated by the House. Conspicuous in the debate, however, was agreement by both sides on the importance of legislative indemnification.

In 1807, a British warship attacked the frigate Chesapeake. With Congress in recess, President Jefferson spent unauthorized funds to build gunboats. “To have awaited previous and special sanction by law,” he explained to Congress in seeking retroactive approval, “would have lost occasions which might not be retrieved... I trust that the Legislature feeling the same anxiety for the safety of our country... will approve, when done, what they would have seen so important to be done if then assembled.” In the debate that preceded congressional sanction of Jefferson’s unauthorized expenditures, members duly emphasized the illegal character of his acts, of course, but they focused on the pivotal question underlying every request for ratification, as expressed on the House floor by the prominent Federalist, Rep. Samuel W. Dana of Connecticut: “Would you... had you assembled at this time, with a knowledge of all the existing circumstances—would you have authorized these expenses to be incurred.” But if Congress did not share the president’s perception of emergency, or the acts that he performed to meet it—if indeed, “the Legislature condemns the procedure,” Dana added, then “the officers must bear the loss.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_145","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_145","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si25869","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si25894","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_240","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_240","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_267","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_267","title":"USS Chesapeake ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_241","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_241","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_268","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_268","title":"Firing on the Leopard ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_242","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_242","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_245","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_245","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_199","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_199","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si31550","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si31582","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_200","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_200","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si31638","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si31664","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_396","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_396","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_372","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_372","title":"Naval Battle of Lake Borgne between U.S. and U.K. forces in the War of 1812.

In the context of defending the Union after the Confederacy attacked Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, and initiated the Civil War, Lincoln assumed powers not granted to the executive by the Constitution. While Congress was in recess, Lincoln issued proclamations calling forth state militias, suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus, and instituting a blockade on the rebellious states. He also spent public funds without congressional authorization. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. observed:  “No President had ever undertaken such sweeping action in the absence of congressional authorization. No President had ever challenged Congress with such a massive collection of faits accompli.”   When Congress convened, Lincoln explained that his actions, “whether strictly legal or not, were ventured upon under what appeared to be a popular demand and a public necessity, trusting then, as now, that Congress would readily ratify them.” After Congress reviewed the circumstances and concluded that Lincoln had acted out of necessity, it passed an act in 1861 approving, legalizing, and making valid all “the acts, proclamations, and orders of the President… as if they had been issued and done under the previous express authority of the Congress of the United States.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_147","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_147","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si26027","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si26052","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_399","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_399","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_377","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_377","title":"President Lincoln and General John A.

In 1824, in The Appollon, the Court for the first time addressed the practice of legislative ratification. The Court levied damages against an executive official for the seizure of a ship and its cargo, despite the fact that he acted on the basis of what he perceived to be an emergency. In an opinion for a unanimous Court, Justice Joseph Story wrote, “It may be fit and proper for the government, in the exercise of the high discretion confided to the executive, for great public purposes, to act on a sudden emergency, or to prevent an irreparable mischief, by summary measures which are not found in the text of the laws.
