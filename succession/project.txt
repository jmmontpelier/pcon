In the exercise of his powers in the Treaty Clause and the Appointment Clause, the president is accountable to the Senate. The president is not granted any authority under the Constitution to  take the nation to war without congressional authorization. Executive aggrandizement of power, it is true, may succeed if unchecked by Congress or the judiciary, but the fact that these branches possess power to check executive abuse of power reminds us that the president may be held accountable by the legislative and judicial branches.

The congressional power of investigation, as well as the powers to censure and impeach the president, like the power of judicial review, are more than sufficient to bring an errant president to heel. But consider the success enjoyed by Congress in holding the president accountable, as seen in the Watergate Hearings or in the congressional investigation into the Iran-Contra Affair. The congressional enactment of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, moreover, provided for the creation of the Independent Counsel to investigate presidential actions and those of other superior officers within the executive branch. And, despite the Supreme Court lapses, as reflected in excessive deference to the president in foreign affairs, it has, indeed, exercised its authority on several occasions to check presidential abuse of power. For example, the Court rebuked President Harry Truman for his unconstitutional seizure of the steel mills, and it rejected President Nixon’s assertion of an absolute executive privilege in the Watergate Tapes Case.  Constitutional accountability is a cornerstone of American Constitutionalism. As the Supreme Court said in United States v. Lee (1882), all “officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law and are bound to obey it.” As a consequence, all governmental officers, the president included, have a responsibility to trace their actions to constitutional norms.

Rather, as in so many areas of the Constitution, the Framers borrowed legal principles and practices from England, although shaping the principles to fit their creation of a republic. In crafting the Impeachment Clause, delegates to the Convention drew upon English principles, as well as impeachment practices under the state constitutions. The Framers’ reading of history and their familiarity with the contemporaneous impeachment in England of Warren Hastings guided their work in the area of impeachment. Edmund Burke, the great champion of the American colonists during the Revolutionary War, was the chief instigator of the Hastings impeachment.

Elbridge Gerry “urged the necessity of impeachments. A good magistrate will not fear them. A bad one ought to be kept in fear of them.” In a reference to the English conception that the King “could do no wrong,” Gerry spoke of Republican values and said that he “hoped the maxim would never be adopted here that the chief Magistrate could do [no] wrong.” Edmund Randolph agreed that an impeachment power was necessary as a means of punishment.  But other delegates expressed worry about an impeachment provision. Gouverneur Morris, for example, was concerned that the legislature would reduce the executive to a state of dependency, and render him subordinate to the legislature. As a consequence, “he will be no check on the Legislature,” and cease to be “a firm guardian of the people and of the public interest.” Charles Pinckney “did not see the necessity of impeachments.” He was certain that the legislature would hold that “rod over the Executive and by that means effectively destroy his independence.”  As the debate moved toward conclusion, Morris changed his mind about the need for impeachment. After listening to the discussion, he was persuaded that the president “might be bribed by a greater interest to betray his trust; and no one would say that we ought to expose ourselves to the danger of seeing the first Magistrate in foreign pay without being able to guard agst. it by displacing him.” Thus the president, Morris believed, should be vulnerable to impeachment for “treachery” as well as corruption and incapacity.

Again and again, delegates to the Constitutional Convention, as well as those serving their state ratifying conventions, expressed their concurrence in the Madisonian- Hamiltonian conception of the basis for impeachment—breach of trust and abuse of office. Charles Pinckney in South Carolina declared that impeachment would lie against those who betrayed their “public trust.” Edmund Randolph in Virginia talked about impeachment for misbehavior. James Iredell, a future member of the U.S. Supreme Court, told his colleagues in North Carolina that the president could be impeached for giving false information to the Senate, and for abusing his foreign affairs powers.

While some acts might, indeed, merit criminal sanctions, those would be carried out in the criminal justice system. Thus the Convention proceeded on the assumption that there were two realms—one for great political offenses, assessed by the impeachment power, and the other for criminal offenses. James Wilson, a leading delegate from Pennsylvania, explained in his lectures on the Constitution, that impeachments are “confined to political characters, to political crimes and misdemeanors, and to political punishments.” In his explanation that impeachment may lie for “malversation,” he meant “corrupt behavior in an office of trust.”  The Framers, then, were in agreement about the necessity of impeachment as a means of bringing an errant president to heel. Eighty-year old Benjamin Franklin told his colleagues in the Convention that impeachment was necessary, for without it, there would be no choice “but recourse to assassination.” There remained, however, the question of the repository of the authority to impeach the president. The Framers were divided on this question.

On September 8, just 10 days before the Convention adjourned, Madison, who was an advocate of vesting the trial authority in the Supreme Court, objected to the trial of the president by the Senate, “especially as he was to be impeached” by the House. In those circumstances, Madison stated, the president would be made “improperly dependent” on Congress. Morris thought that “no other tribunal than the Senate could be trusted.” Justices of the Supreme Court “were too few in number and might be warped or corrupted.”  He thought it unlikely that members of the Senate “would say untruly on their oaths that the President was guilty of crimes or facts, especially as unlikely four years he can be turned out.” The various concerns about vesting the trial power in the Supreme Court, captured in Roger Sherman’s warning that it would be “improper” to assign the Court that role “because the judges would be appointed” by the president, combined with the perceived virtues of granting that role to the Senate, led the Framers to place the trial authority in the upper chamber of Congress.  In the course of American history, three presidents—Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton—have faced impeachment proceedings. Of the three, Johnson and Clinton were impeached by the House of Representatives. Both presidents were acquitted in Senate trials. Nixon was not impeached. The House Judiciary Committee had voted Articles of Impeachment against him, but he was spared impeachment and, very likely, conviction by the Senate and thus removal from office, by virtue of his resignation of the presidency.

If the Senate was in recess and unable to act on the replacement, the president could suspend, but not remove, the official. Johnson believed the law encroached on his authority and he decided to challenge it in court. But when he unilaterally removed Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, the House initiated impeachment proceedings. The House impeached Johnson but the Senate failed to muster the two-thirds majority for his removal. Each of the three articles of impeachment fell short by a single vote.  In August of 1867, President Johnson suspended Stanton from office. In January of 1868, the Senate refused to concur in the suspension. The Tenure of Office Act included a criminal penalty for violations, which it declared to be “high misdemeanors.”  On the same day that Johnson suspended Stanton, the Senate passed a resolution stating that “under the Constitution and laws . . . the President has no power to remove the Secretary of War and to designate any other officer to perform the duties of that office ad interim.” Two days later, the House impeached Johnson by a vote of 126 to 47.

If he was mistaken about the constitutionality of the statute, he should not be impeached for his good faith error in interpretation. Lastly, there was no injury inflicted on the public. At most, his offense was minor in nature, and did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. The Senate ultimately voted on three articles of impeachment, advanced by the House. Article 11 charged Johnson with falsely declaring that the 39th Congress was not authorized to execute legislative power for the entire nation, since it was only a Congress that was representative of some of the states. His false characterization was said to have scandalized Congress and caused its reputation to fall into a state of disrepute. The other two articles of impeachment involved the appointment of Thomas.

Harding’s Secretary of Interior, who became the first Cabinet member in the history of the United States to go to jail for activities in office. The scandal inflicted a severe wound in Harding’s reputation and legacy. In 1921, Harding appointed Albert Fall to the top post at Interior. Although he was a westerner and an advocate of national parks, Fall was not a conservationist and believed that the nation’s resources—including oil—on public lands should be made available to developers.   The Navy had taken control, in 1920, of two large oil reserves that had been secured during the presidency of William Howard Taft, and a third at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, acquired during the administration of Woodrow Wilson. Secretary Fall persuaded President Harding to issue an executive order to transfer the three oil reserves from the Department of the Navy to the Department of Oil. Fall had explained that Interior could better manage drainage of oil to adjacent private property.  Fall subsequently leased—without taking public bids—Elk Hills in California to Edward L. Doheny, President of Pan-American Oil Company, and Teapot Dome to Harry Sinclair, head of the Sinclair Oil Corporation, in exchange for a 16 percent royalty. The deal angered conservationists, who convinced Senator Robert M. La Follette to pursue an investigation, which the U.S. Senate undertook under the leadership of Senator Thomas J. Walsh. Walsh, however, did not aggressively pursue the inquiry since his views about resources were similar to those held by Secretary Falls.

The cover-up by President Nixon of the break-in and bugging of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington D.

In one conversation, President Nixon was heard to order the CIA to shut down the FBI’s investigation of the Watergate break-in, a clear example of obstruction of justice. Nixon said, “And, uh, for that reason, I am perfectly willing to—I don’t give a shit what happens.

Nixon was heard on tape that he could “get” the money. When the tapes were released, Nixon knew that impeachment “was a foregone conclusion.” He announced his resignation on August 8, 1974, effective the next day.   The name, Watergate, became a synonym for a complex of illegality, unconstitutionality, and corruption associated with the Nixon administration. The scandal brought down the president and spurred some congressional remedies, including enactment of the Ethics in Government Act, which provided a statutory basis for the appointment of a special prosecutor or independent counsel to investigate wrongdoing within the executive branch. But the long-term remedies for Nixon’s abuse of power didn’t last forever, as Congress let the Independent Counsel statute lapse. Critics of President Ford’s pardon of Richard Nixon contend that while the act of mercy spared Nixon, it short-circuited the criminal justice system and the possibility of bringing Nixon to justice. It was observed that Ford’s pardon was premature; indeed, there would have been time enough to pardon Nixon after the legal process had run its course. Thus, many wondered what might be done to deter future instances of presidential abuse of power.

Following the overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship by center-left Sandinistas in 1979, President Jimmy Carter sought a measured relationship based on goodwill. Upon entering the Oval Office, however, President Ronald Reagan reversed the policy and suspended aid to the Sandinista regime. By 1982, the Reagan Administration had implemented a policy of aiding the efforts of the right-wing Contras to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. President Reagan’s enthusiasm for the Contras was exhibited in his public statement: “I’m a contra, too!” He likened the Contras to the American colonists who revolted against England. Reagan’s policy ran afoul of his publicly stated goal of merely interdicting the flow of Nicaraguan arms to those in neighboring El Salvador who were friendly to the Sandinistas.   Disclosures about the gap between the Reagan Administration’s public position and its covert operations led Congress to enact the first Boland Amendment, which prohibited the Department of Defense and the CIA from providing any aid or assistance to the Contras. President Reagan continued to pursue means of supporting the Contras. He sought aid for the Contras from allies and also simply ignored the prohibitions, as manifested in the CIA’s mining of three Nicaraguan ports. News of these unilateral actions triggered a second Boland Amendment. Like the first ban, these new prohibitions sought to tighten the financial strings by banning all aid, direct or indirect, for a specific one-year period, which applied to “any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_105","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_105","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20749","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20774","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_106","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_106","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20828","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20853","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_188","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_188","title":"Nicaraguan Contras ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_162","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_162","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_189","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_189","title":"Edward Boland ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_163","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_163","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_165","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_165","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_166","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_166","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_128","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_128","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22955","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22981","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_129","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_129","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23037","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23063","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide17532","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Reagan Administration","thumbnail":"dr/Slide17532_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si17566","si17568","Text_Caption_165","Text_Caption_166","btn_previous_105","si20749","si20774","btn_next_106","si20828","si20853","Text_Caption_188","Image_162","Text_Caption_189","Image_163","Image_165","Image_166","Button_128","si22955","si22981","Button_129","si23037","si23063"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide17532"}}},{"id":"si17646","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si17648","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_57","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_57","title":"Presidential Succession and Impeachment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_44","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_44","title":"Covert Support of the Contras ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_167","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_167","title":"Creating the Iran-Contra Affair ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_168","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_168","title":"Despite the blanket prohibition put in place by Congress, a staff member of the National Security Agency, Lt.

He and his colleagues, moreover, solicited funds from American citizens, who could be convinced that aiding the Contras was a means of fighting the worldwide communist conspiracy.  North remained in charge of the program to aid the Contras until it was exposed at the end of 1986 and became a major scandal. By that point, North’s efforts were closely linked with efforts of the Reagan Administration to sell TOW Missiles to Iran, without authorization from Congress. Indeed, the sale of American property was hidden from Congress. A portion of the proceeds was diverted to aid the Contras, creating, in effect, the Iran-Contra Affair. The Reagan Administration, despite its public opposition to negotiating with terrorists, was, in fact, selling arms to Iran for twin purposes: to encourage moderates in Iran and to obtain the release of American hostages.

Their convictions were subsequently overturned on grounds that their limited immunity granted by Congress in exchange for testimony had been tainted by information given to Congress under the immunity grant.   The final leg of the Iran-Contra investigation stretched into late 1992. Judge Walsh had doggedly followed the trail of evidence that suggested White House approval of the Iran-Contra Affair. Lt. Col. Oliver North had testified to Congress that President Reagan had authorized his activities, but many were less than certain about the veracity of North’s claims. President Reagan had denied authorization of support for the Contras and, indeed, denied knowledge of the program. He later admitted that he had, unwittingly, traded for hostages. Meanwhile, Vice President George H.W. Bush had likewise denied any knowledge of the Iran-Contra Affair.

Walsh’s legal staff discovered some of Weinberger’s notes from Reagan Cabinet meetings that reported approval of the Iran-Contra efforts by both President Reagan and Vice President Bush. The pending trial of Secretary Weinberger for his role in Iran-Contra garnered a great deal of media attention. It was clear that Walsh intended to ask Weinberger to verify the accuracy of his notes about the Cabinet meetings. His responses might implicate both Reagan and Bush, and perhaps set the stage for their indictment and potential trial. On December 24, 1992, President Bush, weeks removed from his re- election defeat at the hands of Bill Clinton, granted a pardon to Weinberger for all offenses that he may have committed against the United States during his service as Secretary of Defense. The pardon precluded the trial of Weinberger which, of course, meant that he would not be asked to testify about the accuracy of his notes from the Cabinet meetings. In Firewall, his book about his six-year tenure as Independent Counsel investigating the Iran-Contra Affair, Walsh included a chapter on the Bush pardon of Weinberger. He entitled the chapter, “The Cover Up.” The presidential pardon, Walsh explained, had turned the trail cold.

Roosevelt in April of 1945, he lamented the fact that the nation would have an unelected vice president for nearly four years. Moreover, as he pointed out, “Since the members of the Cabinet are all presidential appointees,” he reasoned in his Memoirs, “the law gave me the power to appoint my own successor until a new Vice President could be elected.” He thought this was a power “no president ought to possess.”  On June 19, 1945, in a special message to Congress, Truman urged a revision of the 1886 statute in the  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_234","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_234","title":"interest of “orderly, democratic government.” Under the 1947 Succession Act, which embodied most of Truman’s recommendations, if there is neither a president nor vice president because of death, resignation, removal from office, inability, or failure to qualify, the Speaker shall “act as President.” If there is no Speaker, or if the Speaker fails to qualify as acting president, the president pro tempore succeeds and shall “act as President.” The detailed statute seemingly addressed the various possibilities of vacancy and succession. Thus, if the Speaker and the president pro tempore are not available or decide that they do not want to serve as president, the Cabinet officials serve in the following order: Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War, Attorney General, Postmaster General, Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor. In every instance, whether Speaker, president pro tempore, or Cabinet officer, the person serving as acting president must be “eligible to the office of President under the Constitution.” In addition, the Cabinet officer must have been appointed “by and with the advice and consent of the Senate” and must not be “under impeachment in the House of Representatives at the time the powers and duties of the office of President devolve upon them.” The 1947 statute is regularly amended to reflect new cabinet-level departments or change of title, such as the change from Secretary of War to Secretary of Defense.

In 1974, Vice President Gerald Ford became president upon the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Succession by death occurred first in 1841 when John Tyler succeeded William Henry Harrison. There was some question of whether Tyler was vice president “acting as president” or actually the president. Tyler decided to take the oath of office, fully authorized to exercise all powers and duties. Members of Congress referred to Tyler as “the President” and that precedent has been followed ever since.  Millard Fillmore became president when Zachary Taylor died of natural causes. The next turnovers resulted from the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, and William McKinley, succeeded by Andrew Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, and Theodore Roosevelt, respectively. A fourth assassination occurred in November 1963, resulting in Lyndon B. Johnson succeeding John F. Kennedy. In two other cases, a vice president became president because of an incumbent’s death by natural causes: Calvin Coolidge replacing Warren G. Harding in 1923, and Harry Truman assuming the presidency after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Those cases involved death or resignation, not disability.

Roosevelt exerted all of his skills to persuade Congress to enact in 1905 the Hepburn Act, the first significant federal regulation of economic activity and paved the way to further expansion of federal regulatory powers. The statute aimed to empower the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) with its first rate-making authority to regulate the railroads. While it disappointed more ardent reformers it did, nevertheless, paved the way for a new regulatory era. His second important piece of domestic regulation was the Pure Food and Drug Act, which led to the creation of a federal agency to exercise oversight authority over food-processing plants. His third, and perhaps most important domestic act, was the creation of the Forest Service, which cemented his reputation as the first Environmental President.

The problems that stirred Congress to set in motion legislation that became the 25th Amendment had confronted the nation throughout American history. Various presidents had suffered from disabilities that affected their ability to perform the duties and responsibilities of the Office of the Presidency. But there was no transfer of power to the vice president in those instances because of the Constitution’s silence on the subject of presidential disability.  Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the Constitution stated that in the case of the president’s “inability” to carry out the duties and powers of his office, that “the Same shall devolve on the Vice President.” But that constitutional provision did not supply guidance on the meaning of inability, the status of a vice president in that instance and, critically, who possessed the authority to determine the beginning and ending of an inability. The Constitution, moreover, made no provision for filling a vacancy in the vice presidency when a vice president either succeeded to the presidency, died in office, or resigned. And yet that was a problem with which the United States had grappled across the decades. Between 1841 and 1967, there had been a vacancy in the vice presidency on 16 occasions, which left the office unoccupied for an aggregate total of 37 years—roughly 25 percent of the nation’s history.

The provisions of the Succession Act of 1947 and the age-related realities of statutory successors seemed to place the United States in a tenuous, if untenable situation. The next in-line lawmakers were Speaker of the House John McCormick and President pro tempore Carl Hayden, who were 72 and 86 years old, respectively. Senator Birch Bayh initiated the discussion and became the driving force to address the problems of disability and succession. He worked from a backdrop of long-standing presidential disabilities: Garfield’s long incapacitation after being shot, the months-long illness of Wilson following a stroke, and Eisenhower’s heart attack in 1955 and stroke in 1957. The 25th Amendment was ratified on February 20, 1967. It was supported by every state except South Carolina, Georgia, and North Dakota.

The amendment sets forth dates when congressional and presidential terms begin and end, what happens if the president-elect dies before his term begins or if no president or vice president has qualified and what happens if a presidential or vice presidential candidate dies under certain contingencies. The overall effect of the amendment’s various parts was to slightly increase the power of the presidency and to improve the provisions for filling presidential vacancies under particular circumstances.  Section 1 provides that the terms of the president and vice president begin and end at noon on January 20, and those of senators and representatives begin and end on January 3.

Section 2 requires Congress to assemble on January 3 each year.  The amendatory changes improved the continuity of the two branches of government. Previously, some four months passed between the popular vote for the president and the vice president and inauguration. This lengthy interim period created a long lame duck session before the White House changed hands. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the 73rd Congress were the last to take office before the adoption of the 20th Amendment. Historically, as we have noted, the president had taken office on March 4, and the first regular session of Congress began in December, some 13 months after its election. As a consequence, every 20th century president, including Roosevelt, had called Congress into special session to avoid the long delay. It is been observed, however, the adoption of the amendment, which cut the time between election and inauguration from four months to about ten and one-half weeks, is too short a time for the transition period for the president-elect to select appointees for approximately 3,000 employees—roughly 40 per day.
