Article II, Section I provides: “Each State shall appoint in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress,” with the proviso that no senator or representative or officer of the U.S. government may be an elector. To succeed, a presidential candidate must receive a majority in the Electoral College, which is today 270 out of 538 votes. Formally, voters choose a spate of electors who are pledged to support a particular candidate’s election in the Electoral College. Rarely do the names of electors appear on the ballot. The total electoral vote of a state accrues to the winner of the popular vote, except for just a few states like New Hampshire, where the decision about allocation of votes occurs by congressional district.  While some, perhaps many, Americans view the presidential race as an intense national battle between contending forces, the reality of the Electoral College system creates a contest waged across 50 states, each of which is a separate election for the electoral vote in each state and in the District of Columbia.  The primary goal of each candidate, then, is to capture 270 electoral votes. At that point, a presidential nominee can claim the mantle of President-Elect of the United States. As a consequence of this electoral arrangement, it is understandable that when candidates and their staffs map out an Electoral College strategy, they speak of winning state electoral votes, not the national popular vote.

As much as possible, candidates concentrate their efforts in the larger electoral states, such as California, New York, Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, and Texas—since winning those nine states alone would guarantee 243 electoral votes. Of course, the makeup of the electorate in each state—its views, values, issues, positions, party allegiance, and partisan tendencies—make it more or less accessible to each candidate. As a consequence, candidates pour campaign resources into those states that they believe they can win, and those that they might lure away from their opponent and thus capture. The Electoral College structure usually means that candidates seldom campaign in states that are considered sure-bets for the other side.   The popular depiction of the electoral map by members of the media, as “red” and “blue” states has proved to be a helpful guide in many elections, facilitating voters’ understanding of the political leanings of various states, but this device is only a guide and may prove inaccurate in some elections. Indeed, in the 2016 presidential race, Americans saw the traditional orientation of states change color:  states once considered blue became red, as Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, won the electoral votes in states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, states considered to be part of the blue “Big Ten Wall,” that were expected to fortify the candidacy of Secretary Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee.  A constantly shifting electoral map would pose more strategic challenges for candidates in their search for a winning combination of state electoral votes.

The Electoral College represented for the Framers of the Constitution a compromise between two less than satisfactory proposals for selecting the president. Some delegates to the Constitutional Convention preferred the system employed by England: legislative selection of the president. It was quickly recognized, however, that congressional selection of the president would be at odds with the separation of powers scheme to which the Convention was committed. Several leading Framers, including James Madison, James Wilson, and Gouverneur Morris favored a direct popular vote. Opponents found fault with this approach, however, by pointing to the likelihood that many voters would have little or no knowledge of presidential candidates. A remedy for this problem might be found in the system of voting for electors who would have knowledge of the candidates, and could exercise their reputable judgment in the selection of the president.   While the Electoral College was useful during the founding period and beyond, at least until voters might acquire adequate information and knowledge about the candidates, it is up for debate whether it has outlived its rationale and utility in an age in which the electorate can know everything it wishes to know about candidates—and often more than we care to know. In addition, the reality that in an age of Democracy, the popular vote, that is, the will of the people, can be overridden by the Electoral College, is undemocratic and invites criticism of the mechanism as an anachronism. In the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, for example, won some two million more popular votes than Donald Trump.

It is unrepresentative. It grants a slight numerical advantage to smaller states. Since the number of votes cast in the Electoral College is based on congressional apportionment and Senate representation, and not on turnout, states with low turnouts are rewarded, not penalized. The real problem with the Electoral College, some say, is that it involves the winner-take-all system. It disenfranchises those who voted for the loser in the state, since all the electoral votes are cast for the winner—in effect permitting the majority to cast their own votes as well as the votes of the losers for their candidate. Thus, members of the minority party in a state that is a one-party state—Democrats in Idaho and Republicans in California, for example—are routinely disenfranchised.  Concerns about the undemocratic nature of the Electoral College are spiked when the losing candidate actually wins the popular vote. We have discussed Hillary Clinton’s loss of the electoral vote to Donald Trump, even though she won some two million more popular votes. In the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore lost the Electoral College vote to George W. Bush, but won the popular vote. This disjunction between the will of the people and the seating of a president based on the Electoral College has also previously occurred in 1824 and 1876.

For a variety of reasons, including the judgment, as explained by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 72, that the Constitution should not limit the ability of the American electorate to choose their Chief Executive, the Framers opposed the idea of term limits.   An informal two-term tradition was started by George Washington when as president, he resisted the requests from his countrymen to serve a third term. He replied that “an elective monarchy is not why we fought the revolution,” and returned to his home at Mount Vernon. Washington’s view was reinforced by President Thomas Jefferson, who shunned the prospect of a third term in office. Washington and Jefferson set in motion what became a two-term tradition that lasted for about 150 years. The tradition was snapped in 1940 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to a third term. In 1944, he was elected to a fourth term, but his death in August of 1945 shortened his tenure in the presidency.

For reasons of principle and fear of ongoing Democratic domination of the Oval Office, the GOP launched an effort to amend the Constitution and to impose term limits on the presidency. They weren’t the first to do so. Indeed, delegates to the Constitutional Convention had considered a single term, as well as the idea of term limits. The Framers were keenly aware, from their reading in history, that longevity in office often was accompanied by abuse of power and corruption. It was, perhaps, only their commitment to voter choice that prevented the imposition of term limits. Americans continued to debate the proposition of limits as the decades passed; indeed, by 1947, at least 270 resolutions in favor of term limits had been introduced in Congress.  In 1947, the Republican-dominated Congress easily passed a resolution limiting a president to two terms. The House of Representatives voted 285 to 121 in favor of it, and the Senate approved it 59-23. Thus it easily satisfied the necessary two-thirds support in both chambers. Within four years, the requisite number of 41 states ratified the proposed the measure and in 1951 the Constitution incorporated the 22nd Amendment. The Amendment did not apply to President Harry Truman, but only to his successors.

In 1986, friends and supporters of President Ronald Reagan pushed for a repeal of the 22nd Amendment, a proposal that represented an effort to prolong Reagan’s tenure in office and to exploit his highly successful fundraising skills, as well as promoting patronage and appointments to office. Of course the cause to promote both Nixon and Reagan were undermined by Watergate and the Iran-Contra Affair respectively. It is likely that similar efforts to repeal the 22nd Amendment will be advanced in the coming decades as partisans seek to preserve and promote their hold on political power.

Fascism has been the scourge of the world before and during WWII, and some remained in power. They represented an existential threat to America’s constitutional democracy. In the years since the passage and ratification of the amendment, America has experienced its own very serious abuses of power in the Oval Office, including the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals that warranted, in the eyes of many, the awesome option of impeachment. Most Americans have come to agree, in the face of world history and executive behavior, that eight years in office are more than enough. Various presidents, including Andrew Jackson and John F. Kennedy, and many prominent scholars, have asserted their views that rotation in office is consistent with republican virtues. Some defenders of the amendment see, for example, an unhealthy assertion of one person’s views and values in the area of appointments to office, leadership of a political party, and the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary as a whole. Finally, defenders of the term limit like to remind people that no one is indispensable, and that in a nation of 300 million people surely there are several qualified citizens able to assume the duties and responsibilities of the presidency.

As for the argument that longevity in office invites abuse of power and corruption, proponents of repeal like to point out that FDR’s long tenure affirms the fact that some can serve in office for several years without being corrupted by the tendencies and temptations of power. Constitutional safeguards in the form of checks and balances, as well as the Bill of Rights, protect the name from the abuse of power. They argue as well, that the amendment has weakened the president by effectively rendering him a lame duck executive the day after his election to a second term.
