They represent a form of administrative lawmaking, and are lawful, so long as they are grounded in statutory authorization or constitutional provisions. In essence, these orders are commands used to take actions or to refrain from taking actions.   The number of executive orders issued throughout American history is unclear. By August 6, 2013, the numbered series had reached 13,651. That number, however, is too modest. The numbering system was based on an effort to track the earliest executive order, characterized as such. That process dates to one issued by President Abraham Lincoln. Since presidents have issued many orders delineated by some other name, and since there was no uniform process for publishing such orders until the passage of the Federal Register Act in 1935, the present numbering system is merely an approximation. Scholarly estimates suggest that some 50,000 executive orders, by some name, have been issued since the Washington Administration.

Presidents may not promulgate an executive order that violates a statute or usurps congressional power. Federal courts have held that Congress may ratify an executive order after it has been issued, as a means or erasing doubts about the legal validity of the order. Thus, in the immediate aftermath of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, issued on February 19, 1942, requiring the removal of Americans of Japanese descent from the West Coast, Congress enacted a statute ratifying the order. Whether the order would have found legal footing on its own accord is unclear, since the Japanese Internment Cases upholding the relocation policy did so based on both the executive order and statutory approval.  The legal validity of an executive order is not contingent upon its labeling as an executive order. The Supreme Court has held that there is no meaningful legal distinction between, for example, an executive order and a presidential proclamation. As a matter of course, proclamations are directed to people outside the government, while executive orders govern the actions of governmental officials and agencies. Proclamations may be used for hortatory purposes such as a national day of celebration, but they have been used for important purposes, including President Washington’s Neutrality Proclamation or President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.

Washington, who invoked the law of nations as authority to declare U.S. neutrality in the war and prohibit American citizens from supporting one side or the other, soon learned that enforcement of his proclamation depended on the willingness of jurors to convict those accused of violating it. But jurors understood that the creation of criminal law in the United States required enactment of statutes passed by Congress. Accordingly, a jury to refused to convict Gideon Henfield for violating Washington’s proclamation. As a result, Washington turned to Congress in December of 1793 and left it to lawmakers to “correct, improve or enforce” the policy established by his administration. In response, Congress passed The Neutrality Act of 1794, which provided the legal basis that Washington needed to issue his neutrality proclamation, and established that Congress, as the repository of the war power, possessed the constitutional authority to determine whether the United States would remain neutral in military conflicts. Washington, who feared accusations of usurpation of power, and wondered whether he had the power to issue the proclamation, happily signed the measure into law.

Lincoln’s proclamation, while unilateral in nature, also implemented earlier congressional confiscation acts, which authorized the seizure of all property (including slaves) of southern states that had taken up arms against the Union.

The administration was so busy and issued so many orders that it could not keep track of all of its activities. As a consequence, the government learned that it had obtained an indictment and brought an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan (1935), without realizing that the section of the regulation on which the proceeding was based had been eliminated by an executive order. When the Court, in Ryan, struck down a portion of the NRA on grounds that it violated the delegation doctrine, it also struck down the executive orders that President Roosevelt had issued to enforce the statute. In response to the chaos that enveloped the NRA, Congress enacted in 1935 a statute creating the Federal Register in which all presidential and agency documents of the effect of law would be published.

The order required the transfer of some 125,000 American citizens of Japanese descent from their homes on the West Coast to inland “relocation centers.” FDR invoked as constitutional authority for his order, the Commander in Chief Clause and the “authority vested in me as President of the United States.” There was no evidence of disloyalty or subversive activity among these Japanese-American citizens, and no criminal charges were brought by the U.S. government. No hearings were afforded, and the punishment was imposed based purely on ancestry and race. FDR’s executive order was ratified by Congress, and the Supreme Court, in two decisions—1943 and 1944—upheld the curfew and detention components of the relocation program. Scholars subsequently exposed the constitutional infirmities of the treatment of Japanese-American citizens, including 14th Amendment violations, President Reagan and Congress issued apologies for the “errors and injustice” of the relocation program, and Congress, in 1992, enacted legislation compensating surviving victims for the losses that they suffered.

Madison (1803), best known as the first case in which the U.S. Supreme Court exercised the power of judicial review to hold unconstitutional a section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, Chief Justice John Marshall drew a distinction between discretionary and ministerial powers. Marshall recognized that the president is vested with “certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character and to his own conscience.” To assist the president in the performance of those duties, “he is authorized to appoint certain officers, who act by his authority, and in conformity with his orders.” In such cases, “their acts are his acts; and whatever opinion may be entertained of the manner in which executive discretion may be used, still there exists, and can exist, no power to control that discretion. The subjects are political. They respect the nation, not individual rights, and being entrusted to the executive, the decision of the executive is conclusive… The acts of such an officer, as an officer, can never be examinable by the courts.”  On various occasions, as Marshall explained, officers must conform to the will of the president. On others, Congress may enact a statute that directs an officer to perform specified ministerial acts. Marshall emphasized the point: “But when the legislature proceeds to impose on that officer other duties; when he is directed peremptorily to perform certain acts; when the rights of individuals are dependent on the performance of those acts; he is so far the officer of the law; is amendable to the laws for his conduct; and cannot, at his discretion sport away the vested rights of others.” When an officer is an “officer of the law,” he is required to perform ministerial duties, as the law provides, and is subject to judicial enforcement.

In Marbury v. Madison, the Court adopted this distinction and established the fundamental nature and scope of judicial control over executive action. William Marbury, whose commission to become a justice of the peace, had not been delivered to him by Secretary of State James Madison, brought a suit in the Supreme Court asking the justices to issue a writ of mandamus to compel Madison to deliver Marbury’s commission, in accordance with his statutory duties. Marshall held that the Court could issue the mandamus since the statute imposed upon the Secretary of State a clear duty to deliver the commission. In the end, however, the Court did not order Madison to deliver the commission since it decided it lacked jurisdiction over the case. The Court underscored the point that it could not order the Secretary to develop a particular foreign policy since that was a discretionary matter in which he acted for the president.   While U.S. courts have employed the ministerial-discretionary distinction since Marbury, presidential decisions, for a variety of reasons, usually avoid depictions as ministerial acts. For one, the president enjoys independent constitutional powers, the scope of which requires respect. For another, statutes often delegate broad powers to the president. For another, statutes often vest functions of a clerical nature in subordinates. Finally, courts are reluctant to reverse a presidential decision, particularly when presidents maintain that an action is necessary, leading courts to conclude that the action is political in nature and thus not reviewable in court.

Earlier, President Truman complied with the Court’s decision in the Steel Seizure Case (1952), when it held unconstitutional his executive order to the Secretary of Commerce to take control of the steel industry to keep it open and operating.   The Court, however, has not ordered the president to make a substantive decision in a particular way. Thus the Court, in Mississippi v. Johnson (1867), dismissed an attempt by the state of Mississippi to enjoin President Johnson from enforcing Reconstruction legislation. In that case, the Court reasoned that the president was not fulfilling a ministerial duty, which it defined as one leaving nothing to discretion. The president’s duty to assign military commanders under Reconstruction, and defining their duties, was not ministerial, but “executive and political.” The Court said that any judicial interference to bar the president’s performance of those duties, would be “an absurd extravagance.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_87","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_87","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20355","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20380","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_88","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_88","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20434","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20459","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_231","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_231","title":"Mississippi v.

Presidents are required by the Constitution to provide written explanations accompanying vetoed bills that they return to Congress. While pocket vetoes are not returned to Congress, presidents typically issue a memorandum of disapproval explaining their objections. When presidents approve bills, they are required only to sign the bill into law. But when presidents have signed major legislation into law, they have often attached signing statements as a means of publicizing, explaining, and justifying their decisions.  These signing statements reflect the executive’s thoughts about the relative merits of the bill, including remarks about the constitutionality of the measure, and how they intend to enforce—or not enforce—provisions of the legislation. Some of these statements can be constructive; others amount to an item veto and, critics point out, an inappropriate intrusion into the exclusive congressional power to assign meaning to the legislation that it has drafted.

The Reagan Administration argued that signing statements should serve as a basis for statutory interpretation. Attorney General Ed Meese was successful in having the president’s signing statements entered in the U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, which helped to elevate the status of such statements. The inclusion of what Meese described as “presidential intent,” generated debate about whose intentions mattered when interpreting a statute, particularly because courts take into account legislative history when construing statutes. Critics of the administration’s position pointed out that Congress, alone, has the authority to assign meaning to the bills that it drafts and passes. Presidents, on the other hand, do not have “intent,” but rather “understanding” of the meaning of a bill. A signing statement, issued on that basis, can explain presidential understanding of the bill and how it will be enforced. But to attribute legal or constitutional significance to a signing statement would represent an illicit substitution of presidential judgment for that of Congress and permit the executive to rewrite legislation after its passage, an exercise in usurpation.

When the president issues a statement, they contend, he is not blocking enactment of a law, which is what occurs with a veto. After issuing a statement, the statute is still on the books. That is true, of course, but the real question surrounds the way in which presidents enforce the law. Through signing statements, the president often engages in a reinterpretation of a statute. President Reagan issued a signing statement when he signed into law the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1986. In his statement, he claimed that the Environmental Protection Agency was not required to enforce the statute, even though he was.   Another example of executive reinterpretation of a statute occurred in 2005, when Congress passed a bill to prohibit torture. The bill declared that no one in the custody of the U.S. government, “regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.” American policy against torture had been long-settled, as manifested in statutes and treaties. When President Bush signed the bill into law, he said he would interpret it “in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power.” Although Bush had the responsibility to “Take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” he decided that he could rewrite legislation to fit his conception of the president’s constitutional powers. By acting in ways consistent with his statement, Bush essentially rewrote the statute.

On occasion, presidents will refuse disclosure of the requested information, for various reasons, including national security, foreign affairs, and diplomatic matters.

In this discussion, we focus on the nature and constitutional parameters of the claim of executive privilege, with a look at the way it has been utilized by presidents.

But since the confrontations surrounding the Watergate crisis, greater focus has been placed on the constitutional claims of each branch. The Supreme Court has held that when the assertions of both the congressional investigative power and the executive power to withhold information are appropriately exercised to discharge the proper functions of their departments, they are to be regarded as “implied powers.” In 1927, the Court held in McGrain v. Daugherty, that Congress “cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change.” Investigations, manifestly, are integral to wise lawmaking.

In United States v. Nixon, Chief Justice Warren Burger, writing for an 8-0 Court (Justice Rehnquist recused himself on grounds of conflict tracing to his work at the Department of Justice on behalf of the Nixon Administration), rejected President Nixon’s claim of an “absolute” executive privilege, but held for the first time in American history that the president enjoyed a “limited” privilege. For the Court, Chief Justice Burger declared that Nixon must comply with a federal district court subpoena to turn over the Watergate Tapes to a federal prosecutor engaged in a Watergate-related criminal case. Burger stated: “Absent a claim of need to protect military, diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets,” no presidential claim of executive privilege could prevail over “the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.” Burger went on to explain that executive privilege was rooted in the separation of powers doctrine. His opinion did not resolve many issues involving executive privilege, including the scope of the privilege, but it provides an important platform for our thorough examination of this presidential power.

Where in the Constitution—in its express provisions or implied derivations—is provision made for executive privilege? Moreover, which of the president’s constitutional assignments require resort to claims of executive privilege?  The Framers of the Constitution made no overt provision for executive privilege, which is not surprising, given their deep-seated fear of executive power. The debates in the Philadelphia Convention evinced no sympathy for executive privilege. James Wilson of Pennsylvania, second in importance to James Madison as an architect of the Constitution, defended the Convention’s decision to establish a single, rather than a plural presidency. “Executive power,” he explained, “is better to be trusted when it has no screen.” Wilson noted the visibility and accountability of the president: “He cannot act improperly, and hide either his negligence or inattention,” and although he possesses sufficient power, “not a single privilege is annexed to his character; far from being above the laws, he is amenable to them in his private character as a citizen, and in his public character by impeachment.” The president was bound by the strictures of the Constitution, made amenable to the laws and the judicial process, and barred from hiding his activities. The Framers’ understanding, as Madison put it, that the executive power should be “confined and defined” affords little ground for the view that executive privilege was regarded as an attribute of executive power that might be advanced to conceal the president’s “negligence or inattention,” though history has proven otherwise. ＀﬈￿艃2ā⭐ᰭ羙 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_101","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_101","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21461","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21486","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_102","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_102","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21540","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21565","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_280","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_280","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_281","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_281","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_271","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_271","title":"James Madison.

The proudest ministers of the proudest monarchs. . . have appeared at the bar of the house to give an account of their conduct.” In addition, the Framers acted out of the belief that the powers vested in Congress—including its general oversight authority to supervise the enforcement of its laws and the implementation of its appropriations, as well as its broad informing function—required legislative access to information possessed by the executive.

Article I, Section 5, requires both houses of Congress to keep and publish journals, except “such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy.” This provision proved divisive in the Constitutional Convention and in the state ratifying conventions. Wilson was one of those who objected. “The people,” he insisted, “have a right to know what their Agents are doing or have done, and it should not lie in the option of the Legislature to conceal their proceedings.” The Framers preferred publicity rather than secrecy, and they understood that information and knowledge were critical to the preservation of liberty and the enterprise of self-governance.  In summary, neither the Constitutional Convention debates—in which the idea of executive privilege was never discussed—nor the text of the Constitution supports the notion that the Founders intended to bestow upon the president the power to conceal information from Congress. Nor at the time of the framing was there either an inherent or implied executive power to conceal information from legislative inquiry. The Framers knew how to grant power, confer immunities, and create exceptions to power, but there is no evidence to support the contention that they ascribed to the president an implied power to undercut the investigatory power of Congress.

Nixon, the Supreme Court ignored the text and the architecture of the Constitution in creating the doctrine of a constitutionally based executive privilege. The Court, in the opinion written by Chief Justice Burger, held that “a presumptive privilege for confidential communications. . . is fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers” and that “to the extent this interest relates to the effective discharge of a President’s powers, it is constitutionally based.” The Court’s employment of a mere ipse dixit served to elevate executive privilege to the constitutional level for the first time. Before that ruling, executive privilege had been known only as an “evidentiary” or “presumptive” privilege—that is, one similar to the lawyer-client or doctor-patient relationship that must yield to the showing of a greater public need.   The Court’s effort to ground executive privilege in the separation of powers is unpersuasive. The separation of powers doctrine does not create or grant power; rather, it constitutes a rough division of authority that presages the Constitution’s doctrine of enumeration of powers, which, if followed, prevents acts of usurpation.  The Court’s claim that executive privilege is “inextricably rooted in the separation of powers” would have astonished Chief Justice John Marshall, who faced the question of a presidential privilege to withhold information from the courts in 1807 in the treason trial of Aaron Burr. Burr had requested from President Thomas Jefferson a letter written to him by Gen. James Wilkinson. Jefferson’s attorney, George Hay, offered to submit the letter to Chief Justice Marshall, “excepting such parts thereof as are, in my opinion, not material for the purposes of justice, for the defense of the accused, or pertinent to the issue. . . The accuracy of this opinion, I am willing to refer to the judgment of the Court, by submitting the original letter for its inspection.” When Jefferson submitted the letter, with certain deletions, he did not assert a right to withhold information from the Court; indeed, he made no challenge to the authority of the court to demand from the president materials relevant to the trial.

The Chief Justice approached the question of a presidential power to withhold information as an evidentiary privilege, not as constitutional power.  To have acknowledged a constitutionally based privilege would have been to acknowledge the claim of presidential authority to draw the line and determine issues of disclosure. But Marshall made it clear that he, not the president, would determine the measure of a president’s authority to withhold material from the Court.    No historical materials, English or American, would have given the Framers an understanding of executive power that included the authority to conceal information from a legislative inquiry. The Framers largely drew their understanding of separation of powers from Montesquieu, who found no grounds in separation of powers for an executive to resist a legislative inquiry. The legislature, Montesquieu wrote, “has a right, and ought to have the means, of examining in what manner its laws have been executed.” That right is an attribute of the English system, unlike others, he noted, in which government officers give “no account of their administration.” In short, for the Framers, the separation of powers did not imply an executive right to withhold information from the legislature. On the contrary, it entailed a strong belief that the legislature had a right to demand from the executive the information it deemed relevant to its inquiries.  The effort to ground executive privilege in the original understanding of the separation of powers fails to withstand historical scrutiny. The case for executive privilege fares little better when early precedents are considered.

This assertion rests on the slender reed of Washington’s response to a House investigation in 1792 into the disastrous campaign of Gen. Arthur St. Clair against the Indians. The House had appointed a committee to investigate the “causes of failure” of the campaign and had vested in it the authority to call for persons and papers to assist its investigation. For his part, Washington recognized the authority of Congress to conduct an inquiry into the conduct of executive officers, which reflected the historic practice of parliamentary inquiries into executive actions. As president, he cooperated completely.  The assertion that Washington claimed executive privilege is drawn not so much from anything he said or did, but rests, rather, on an excerpt from Secretary of State Jefferson’s notes of a cabinet meeting. Jefferson wrote that the cabinet had agreed that the “house was an inquest, and therefore might institute inquiries,” but determined that the president had discretion to refuse papers, “the disclosure of which would injure the public.” There is no reason to doubt the accuracy of Jefferson’s notes, but little precedential value can be gleaned from this episode. First, Washington complied with the committee’s demand and supplied all materials and documents relevant to the failed expedition. He offered no separation of powers objection. Second, there is no evidence that Jefferson’s notes were presented to Congress or filed with the government. In short, they formed no part of the official record; there was no assertion to Congress of an executive privilege and no statement or declaration of an executive power to withhold information from Congress. Finally, the incident’s precedential value is vitiated by the fact that neither Washington nor Jefferson ever invoked the St. Clair “precedent” in subsequent episodes that allegedly involved their respective claims to executive privilege.

President Washington freely supplied information to Congress pursuant to investigations of the St. Clair disaster and accusations of impropriety brought against Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. He refused demands from the House for information relative to the Jay Treaty, but not for reasons of executive privilege. Rather, he withheld the requested materials on grounds that the House has no part in the treaty power. During Washington’s tenure, the question was not executive concealment from Congress, but disclosure to the public. Thus the executive branch furnished requested information to Congress, which, in turn, decided whether or not to share the information with the American citizenry. On some occasions, Congress furnished the information to the public; on others, Congress persuaded the president to make the disclosures. Congress made these decisions based on its exclusive authority under Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution to withhold information from the citizenry. At all events, what emerged from this early period was not a record of constitutionally based claims to executive privilege, but rather an institutional practice of comity between the president and Congress.

The president’s constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws requires no resort to executive privilege; indeed, it was President Nixon’s invocation of executive privilege that obscured his failure to faithfully enforce the laws. Moreover, the exercise of the pardon and veto powers are subject to close scrutiny and demand accountability and explanation—hardly criteria for concealment. The appointment power—a shared power, it bears reminder—cannot be carried out unless the president and Senate cooperate, a dynamic that precludes the claim of executive privilege.

Those who are against executive privilege in this areas argue that the constitutional governance of American foreign policy reflects the Framers’ commitment to collective decision making and their fear of executive unilateralism.

Further, the president is Commander in Chief of the armed forces, but in this capacity he is accountable to Congress and thus possesses no authority to withhold information from it. And, in partnership with the Senate, the president appoints ambassadors and makes treaties. Because neither power can be effectuated without the consent of both parties, the claim of privilege would defy not only the text and structure of the Constitution, but also the values, policy concerns, and logic that undergird the partnership. On the other hand, Alexander Hamilton explicitly argues against those who believe that “a vigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government in Federalist No. 70. Hamilton proceeds to make the case for a vigorous executive, arguing: ”Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_115","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_115","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22567","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22592","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_116","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_116","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22646","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22671","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_286","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_286","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide17989","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Executive Privilege in Foreign Policy and National Security","thumbnail":"dr/Slide17989_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si18023","si18025","Text_Caption_175","Text_Caption_176","btn_previous_115","si22567","si22592","btn_next_116","si22646","si22671","Image_286"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide17989"}}},{"id":"si18154","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si18156","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_62","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_62","title":"Presidential Independence from Congress ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_50","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_50","title":"Executive Privilege and the Commander in Chief Clause ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_133","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_133","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_179","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_179","title":"Granting the War Power to Congress ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_180","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_180","title":"The War Clause vests in Congress the  authority to initiate military hostilities, unbridled or minor, on behalf of the American people.

Barreme (1804). And Congress, as Madison observed, has the authority to “commence, continue and conclude war.” As a consequence of these sweeping powers, Congress has every right to information about the status of military activities. Indeed, an executive decision to withhold such information from Congress would undercut its performance of constitutional responsibilities.
