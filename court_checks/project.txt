Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”   The authority to grant pardons, the roots of which are traceable to the royal prerogative of the English monarchy, is at once the most imperial and delicate of the president’s powers. A presidential pardon precludes the punishment of a person who has committed an offense against the United States. In view of the fact that the impeachment exception is the only explicit textual limitation on the exercise of the power, scholars have described the authority as unfettered and immune to the doctrine of checks and balances. In dictum, the Supreme Court has characterized the pardon power as “unlimited.”  The apparently untrammeled power always has carried with it a great potential for abuse. The Framers of the Constitution were steeped in English history; the King frequently used pardons as partisan indulgences for friends and supporters. In spite of their familiarity with absolutist Stuart claims and their fear of a power-hungry executive with a proclivity for usurpation, the Framers opted, by the Pardon Clause, to vest the president with a broad discretion to correct miscarriages of justice and to restore tranquility in the wake of rebellion.

Executive mercy, found in ancient Mosaic, Greek, and Roman law, was introduced into English jurisprudence in the 7th century, according to Blackstone, on the grounds that all offenses are committed against the King’s peace, and since it is the King who is injured by fighting in his house, it is reasonable that he alone should possess the power of forgiveness. The act of mercy, then, would be dispensed by the King in his grand role as the “fountain of justice.” The historical record suggests, however, that the grant of pardon was not so much an act of grace as it was the tool of pecuniary and political aggrandizement. Pardons often were sold for fees and used as an instrument of conscription to entice convicted felons and murderers to support military adventures. Evidently, pardons were so easily obtainable for persons who had committed such crimes as homicide, larceny, and robbery that law-abiding subjects who had accused them ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_117","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_117","title":"feared retribution, a prospect that also discouraged others from making accusations. The systematic abuse of the pardon power across several centuries provoked numerous complaints from Parliament, which feared for its statutes, and eventuated in a constitutional crisis in the late 17th century between the House of Commons and the Crown. The bold attempt by Charles II to use the pardon power as a means to preempt the impeachment in 1678 of the Earl of Danby, Lord High Treasurer of England, triggered a constitutional crisis that would have resounding implications for the presidential pardon power: May a royal pardon prevent an impeachment? For members of the Commons, who viewed the impeachment power as a means of bringing corrupt ministers to heel, the act of executive clemency could not be tolerated. It was feared that a pardon before trial would stifle testimony and therefore bury the facts surrounding the plot. Had the Commons acquiesced in the pardon, the pretended accountability of the ministers would have ceased, for the King would have been free to exercise the prerogative to screen them from parliamentary inquiry. Charles did not want to lose his trusted aide, but Danby was not worth another civil war. Therefore, in spite of the pardon, Danby spent five years in the Tower of London, without trial. In legislation that effectuated the arguments and sentiments expressed by the Commons during the Danby Affair, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement in 1700, which declared that an impeachment could not be impeded by a pardon.

For most states, it was the norm: a pardon may not be pleaded to bar impeachment. Exceptions to this practice were more restrictive of the pardoning authority, as reflected, for example, in the absolute denial to the governor of a pardon power, in the requirement that pardons were contingent upon approval from the legislature, or in the prohibition of pre-conviction pardons.  The Constitutional Convention refused to embrace these restrictions. The debate on the pardon power was framed by a proposal from Charles Pinckney of South Carolina that mirrored the English practice. The impeachment exception evoked no controversy since the Framers were familiar with the Danby Affair and they had no desire to vest the president with a power that had been denied to the Crown. The Convention focused principally on the  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_119","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_119","title":"question of whether the president should be empowered to grant pardons for treason, an issue that occasioned an impassioned debate. Some delegates, including Alexander Hamilton, would have permitted pardons for treason, but only if the Senate approved. In rhetoric that stirred images of a presidential coup and sharply echoed the concerns of the Commons a century before, George Mason warned that a president might issue pardons “to screen from punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt.” In the end, in spite of their fear of the subversion of the Republic by pardons, the Framers could not bring themselves to fashion an exception for treason. From history and first-hand experience in the form of Shays’ Rebellion, the Framers were familiar with the seductive potential of a well-aimed and well-timed pardon to quell rebellions and restore tranquility. Without such an option, rebels might just as well die on the battlefield than by the gallows. The wisdom and the potential benefits of that policy, however, would not have overcome fears of presidential complicity in treasonous activities without assurances from James Wilson of the availability of impeachment to curb abuse of the pardon power. In fact, every warning that the president might use the pardon power to exonerate accomplices to forestall investigations and generally to subvert law and government was met with assurances that the threat of impeachment would prevent such conduct.

Since the timing of a pardon offered to rebels was critical and since Congress was not expected to be in continuous session, there was little choice but to vest the power in the president. But the Framers’ reluctance was alleviated by Wilson’s reassuring remarks about the restraining impact of impeachment, and by a rationale, later explained by Hamilton in Federalist No. 74, that the president’s realization that the very fate of an individual might rest on his shoulders, would assure a scrupulous exercise of the authority in order to avoid accusations of weakness or connivance.   The Convention’s creation of a virtually unlimited presidential pardon power has been confirmed by the judiciary. A pardon may be issued before conviction, but not before an offense has been committed, for such an act would amount to the power to dispense with the laws, the claim to which led to King James II’s forced abdication. A pardon may be conferred absolutely or conditionally, provided the conditions are constitutional. However, whether a pardon may be conferred over the objections of the recipient is not clear since the acceptance of a pardon is generally considered an admission of a crime. The power to pardon also includes the authority to commute sentences, and to remit fines, penalties, and forfeitures. It has been held that the pardon power, which includes authority to issue a general amnesty, may not be restricted by congressional legislation, but since Congress also has authority to grant general amnesties, the exercise of its power may confer clemency in terms more generous than the president’s.

With few exceptions, the country has been well served by the exercise of the power. President George Washington initiated the use of the pardon authority in 1795 when he issued a proclamation of amnesty to participants in the Whiskey Rebellion. Since then, pirates who have assisted United States military causes, participants in insurrections, deserters, federal officials and polygamists, among others, have received clemency. An occasional pardon—to Jefferson Davis and the Confederate soldiers, or to Richard M. Nixon, or to Vietnam War draft evaders, for example—has excited intense controversy and heightened public interest in the power; but a great many pardons have been issued without fanfare to federal prisoners who have reached the late stages of their lives and are near death. The frequency and volume of pardons granted, moreover, are perhaps greater than most Americans would suppose. During the Civil War and its aftermath, Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson issued amnesties to some 200,000 persons. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt exercised the power to restore the civil rights of about 1,500 persons who had completed prison terms for violating the draft or for espionage acts during World War I, and in 1945 he restored citizenship rights to several thousand former convicts who had served at least one year in the military and subsequently had earned an honorable discharge. In 1946, President Harry S. Truman granted pardons to more than 1,500 people who had been sentenced to prison for violating the Secret Service Act, and on Christmas Day, 1952, he restored civil rights to 9,000 people who had been convicted of desertion during peacetime. In addition to the more than 10,000 beneficiaries of the Vietnam War clemency and amnesty programs of Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, some 4,600 pardons and 500 commutations were granted between 1953 and 1984 by presidents from Dwight Eisenhower to Ronald Reagan.

Vice President Cheney and his circle remained furious with Bush for not granting a pardon instead of a commutation.  These controversial presidential actions have one thing in common: each president circumvented the Office of the Pardon Attorney and the review process historically conducted to ensure a full, thorough, and fair evaluation of petitions seeking a pardon. In each case, the petitioners did not comply with the established procedure, which requires an initial completion and filing of an application with the Office of Pardon Attorney. In each case, petitioners sought relief directly from the president. That deprived the executive of the benefits of the screening and evaluation of the petition for a pardon performed by attorneys in the pardon office, as well as their recommendation to the president. Manifestly, it’s not necessary for a president to seek advice from anyone while contemplating the issuance of a pardon; indeed, he may take his own counsel.

Legally, a presidential pardon may be granted before conviction, and even before indictment. The Framers, as we have seen, anticipated that a pre-trial pardon might be useful. So there was no question of the legality of the pardon, though many questioned its wisdom since, critics argued, it short-circuited the criminal justice process and a possible conviction of Nixon. Ford may have paid a high price for pardoning Nixon. Indeed, public resentment of the pardon may have contributed to Ford’s very close loss to Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election. In any case, President Ford’s rationale for granting a pardon to Nixon reflected noble aspirations. He told a House Judiciary Committee, as well as the American people, in a nationally televised address to both houses of Congress that the nation was paralyzed by Watergate and that it was necessary to move past the trauma of the event, something he believed was not possible without the pardon, ending the suspense of a possible criminal trial for Nixon, grounded on his obstruction of justice.

Bush’s pardon of former Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger, and six others, on December 24, 1992, for their role in the Iran-Contra Affair, was suggestive of self-interest. Bush’s pardon of Weinberger was criticized because he had a conflict of interest. When the pardon was granted, it halted the criminal proceedings against Weinberger, who was set to go to trial.

Critics pointed out that Bush’s pardon of Weinberger spared Bush, that it represented, precisely, the Framers’ fear that a president might pardon an aid, ally, or crony to “screen” himself from responsibility or punishment. Lawrence Walsh was infuriated. As he described the pardon in his book, Firewall, Bush had turned “the trail cold,” and deprived the American people of knowing the truth about the Iran-Contra Affair.

Fourteen accepted the conditions attached to the clemency, including renunciation of violence. This group had been convicted and imprisoned for seditious conspiracy, for planting more than 130 bombs in public places, including restaurants and shopping malls. Six people were killed and more than 70 people injured. Clinton’s act released members of FALN from prison after serving less than 20 years of terms running from 55 to 90 years.  Clinton’s pardon of FALN members was met with widespread criticism from editorialists and television commentators, as well as members of the House and Senate. The FBI was opposed to the pardon, which earned sharp, bi-partisan condemnation. The House resolution passed by a vote of 311 to 41. A Senate resolution criticizing the pardon was adopted five days later, 95-2. The clemency triggered a renewed call for a constitutional amendment limiting the president’s pardon power by giving the House or Senate, or both chambers, a veto over presidential acts of clemency.

Most of the individuals on that list, according to the Office of the Pardon Attorney, had not applied for pardons. Nor did the FBI conduct a record check on those who had received clemency from Clinton. The most prominent of those pardoned was Marc Rich, charged in 1983 with conducting the largest tax-evasion scheme in American history. Rich had fled to Switzerland, rather than standing trial. His former wife, Denise Rich, met with President Clinton and donated some $450,000 to Clinton’s presidential library in Little Rock, in addition to a contribution of more than $1 million to the Democratic Party. A close friend of Denise Rich also met with President Clinton and promised to raise $1 million for the Clinton Library.  President George W. Bush’s commutation of Scooter Libby’s sentence on charges of obstruction of justice was similarly controversial. Libby, who had served as Chief of Staff for Vice President Cheney, was investigated by a special counsel for the leak of classified information regarding the Bush Administration’s decision to go to war against Iraq in March of 2003. Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison, fined $250,000, and given two years’ probation on conviction of obstruction of justice and perjury before a grand jury. Vice President Cheney had lobbied President Bush to issue a full pardon to Libby, but was unsuccessful. Still, Bush’s reduction of Libby’s sentence from 30 months to zero months surprised many observers who noted the substantial sanctions imposed upon agency whistleblowers for releasing confidential documents to the public. Bush believed the sentence to be “excessive,” but critics wondered why, if that were so, the sentence was commuted to 15 months, or even 10 months.

This is especially true with respect to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as senators and perhaps other influential figures in the home state of the nominee, as long as they are members of the president’s party. Presidential consultation with senators from the candidate’s home state must be cultivated, lest they invoke the longstanding principle of “senatorial courtesy,” which will undermine the nominee’s chances for confirmation. That old tradition is based on the expectation of presidential consultation with the home-state senator. Otherwise, the aggrieved senator will appeal to colleagues and the Senate will almost certainly defeat the nominee. The tradition, then, which is most pronounced in lower court appointments, virtually guarantees an influential role for senators in the appointment power.   The Senate’s formal role in the appointment process is extensive. The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings, which may be more or less intense, depending on the credentials, views, background and experience of the nominee. Prior to the hearings, the committee will present the nominee with a questionnaire that probes the qualifications, including a financial disclosure report to provide information of income, assets, and liabilities. The committee, moreover, will receive from the White House, Justice Department, and the FBI, insights into the nominee’s personal life and professional career. The committee will not commence its hearings until it has received all of the pertinent information about the judicial candidate. During the course of the proceedings, the Senate will hear testimony from many witnesses, including those supporting and opposing the nominee. The Senate’s work may well be informed by press reports and accounts that illuminate the nominee’s career and qualifications.

The ABA’s evaluation of nominees has provided good results since its inception in 1946, although it has had its share of critics, some of whom maintain that responsibility for judicial nominations should rest with the executive branch, as outlined in Article III of the Constitution. The committee’s work, really a pre-formal nomination review, was valued by Eisenhower, and utilized by subsequent presidents, until President Nixon, upset with the ABA’s disapproval of some of his some of his nominees in 1970-1971, refused to submit names of nominees to the committee until he had selected and publicized them. As a consequence, presidents, jealous of their authority, and reluctant to suffer criticism of their nominees, refused to give the ABA the authority to block their candidates. In 2001, President George W. Bush informed the ABA that it would no longer receive advance notice of judicial nominees. Unaffected by the disposition of the executive branch, the Senate Judiciary Committee continued to rely on ABA evaluations. In 2009, President Barack Obama revived the practice dating to the Truman Administration, and indicated that he would submit names to the ABA before sending the name of a nominee to the Senate.

Historical practice reveals four primary considerations: objective merit, personal friendship, balancing representativeness on the Court, and political and ideological compatibility. Among these considerations, the concern to balance representation—geographic, religious, race, and gender—have become prominent in the reasoning of presidents from both political parties. The interest in race and gender, no doubt, carry some political weight. President Ronald Reagan, for example, was heralded by advocates of gender equality for nominating Justice Sandra Day O’Connor to the Supreme Court, the first time that a woman had been nominated to the Court. The death of Justice Thurgood Marshall, a liberal icon and the first African-American named to the Court, created another historic opportunity for President George H.W. Bush to nominate a second African-American jurist, Clarence Thomas, which he did. President Barack Obama’s nomination to the Court of Sonia Sotomayor, an eminently well-qualified lawyer and federal court jurist, and the first Latina to be nominated to the High Bench, was perceived to promote the Obama Administration’s standing among the Hispanic community.

Justice Harry Blackmun, a Nixon appointee, was viewed as a rock-ribbed conservative, widely expected to stay within the shadow of his equally conservative Minnesota twin, Chief Justice Warren Burger, also a Nixon nominee. But after a few years on the Court, Justice Blackmun found his own voice and, by the end of his distinguished career on the Court, had become one of the more liberal justices.

While the Court has exhibited broad deference to the president in the area of foreign affairs and national security for the past 80 years, it does, at least occasionally, check the executive branch, more so in domestic than foreign affairs, as reflected in landmark cases. The Steel Seizure and Watergate Tapes cases are illustrative.  In 1952, in Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer Co. (Steel Seizure case), the Court declared President Truman’s seizure of the steel mills unconstitutional. Truman, a Democrat, was surprised, even angered by the Court’s ruling. All nine members of the Court had been appointed by either Truman or his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt. As a long-time friend and poker-playing buddy with the justices, Truman thought he was on solid ground in seizing the steel industry as a means of preventing a nationwide strike that he believed would undermine America’s ability to fight the war in Korea and rebuild Europe through the Marshall Plan. What’s more, he had been told by two members of the Court, Chief Justice Fred Vinson and Associate Justice Tom Clark, both of whom he had nominated, that his action would be upheld by the Court. But his assertion of inherent presidential power was rebuffed by the High Tribunal. The Court’s rebuke chilled the friendly relations between the justices and the president. Months later, at a reception, Truman told his old friend, and fellow New Dealer, Justice Hugo Black: “I don’t agree with your jurisprudence, but by golly I sure do like your bourbon.” To his credit, Truman complied with the Court’s decision, acknowledging his duty to faithfully execute the laws.

In the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt campaigned against the Court’s conservative economic philosophy and its rulings holding New Deal legislation unconstitutional. In his 1936 reelection bid, which he won by a landslide margin, Roosevelt criticized what he characterized as the Court’s “horse and buggy jurisprudence.” Soon after his victory, FDR announced his “Court-Packing Plan,” which would have given him the authority to expand the number of the Supreme Court Justices from nine to fifteen by nominating six additional Justices, enough to change the complexion of the Court, provided that his nominees were approved by the Senate and that, once on the Court, they would vote ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_172","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_172","title":"in a manner that would sustain the New Deal philosophy. FDR’s plan was defeated by the Senate, in which the administration had chosen to originate the legislation, but not before the Court changed its mind—“A Switch in Time Saves Nine”—and upheld key pieces of New Deal legislation. At that point, as the Court changed its constitutional interpretations, it mattered little to Roosevelt that his plan had been defeated, for if he had lost the battle, he had won the war. In 1968, President Nixon’s sharp criticism of the liberal decisions rendered by the Warren Court, aided what became his successful campaign for the presidency. Nixon’s harsh criticism of the Warren Court’s rulings in the area of criminal justice and civil rights, was accompanied by a promise to appoint only “strict constructionist” judges, whom he believed, would demonstrate fidelity to the text of the Constitution. In 1980, and again in 1984, President Reagan captured presidential elections grounded, in part, on sharp attacks on the Court for its rulings on abortion rights of women. While Reagan was able to direct his Solicitor General to take lawsuits to the judiciary, seeking a ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, the premier decision on the subject of abortion, he was unable to control the words, votes, and opinions of his nominee, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who not only maintained the integrity of Roe, but also wrote an opinion providing substantial protection for a woman’s right to abortion by introducing the “undue burden” test.
