This question is often sparked by a legend involving President Andrew Jackson and the Court’s ruling in Worcester v. Georgia (1832).  The story begins with the celebrated case of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831). In this case, Chief Justice John Marshall ruled against the argument that the Cherokees were a sovereign nation. He has ruled against President Jackson’s claim that they were subject to state law. The tribes, Marshall declared, were “domestic dependent nations,” subject to the authority of the United States, as a ward is to a guardian. When white missionaries defied Georgia law by entering Indian territory without a license from the state, they were arrested and sentenced to the penitentiary.  In Worcester, Chief Justice Marshall struck down the Georgia law and all Georgia laws dealing with the Cherokees. The state of Georgia had no intention of complying with the Court’s ruling and, in fact, boycotted the judicial proceedings. When Jackson learned of the decision, he is said to have replied: “Well, John Marshall has made his decision: now let him enforce it!” There is no evidence to support the claim that Jackson said this; thus, it is a matter of legend. Indeed, it’s highly unlikely that he would have uttered those words because there was nothing for Jackson to enforce as president. Marshall had ordered the superior court of Georgia to reverse its decision. Had the Georgia court refused this order, then Jackson might have been expected to enforce the Supreme Court’s ruling. As the episode unfolded, the governor of Georgia, under pressure from Jackson, pardoned the missionaries with the understanding that they would make no further motion before the Supreme Court. The Cherokees yielded, signed a removal treaty, and headed west along what they called a “Trail of Tears.” Jackson had left the White House by the time that occurred.

If it were a condition of the Court’s decision, then the very concept of limited government and the rule of law would be compromised. It has been suggested, although without demonstrable evidence, that Chief Justice John Marshall, in Marbury v. Madison (1803), refrained from ordering Secretary of State James Madison to comply with his statutory duty to deliver Marbury’s commission to him out of fear that President Jefferson might not comply with such a ruling. Just two years later, in United States v. Hooe (1805), Marshall was warned that “there was no means of compelling” the United States to pay costs. He replied, “that would make no difference, because we are to presume that they would pay them, if bound by law so to ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_117","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_117","title":"do.” Manifestly, Marshall was undeterred in reaching his conclusion in Worcester by rumors that Jackson would not comply with the Court’s ruling. Whether justices have been deterred from reaching the merits of a case out of concern that its decision would not be enforced by a president who disagrees with the ruling, has been the subject of considerable scholarly commentary. For example, on 13 separate occasions, the Supreme Court was asked to rule on the constitutionality of the Vietnam War, but the Court refused to reach the merits for a variety of reasons, including invocation of non-justiciability, the political question doctrine, and the doctrine of equitable construction, among others. While some scholars criticized the Court for not reaching the merits, others defended it on grounds of prudence. The defense of the Court took into account the inability of the Court to force the sitting president—Richard Nixon—to carry out its ruling, in the event that it held the war unconstitutional for lack of congressional authorization, and the president wanted to continue to wage it. The conclusion was that President Nixon might give a wink and a nod to the Court’s ruling, paying lip service, while continuing to engage in military hostilities, which would undermine the Court’s prestige, and hence its power.

The suspension was gradually widened. Lincoln was aware of the concerns surrounding his questionable authority to suspend the Writ of Habeas Corpus, and noted that, as president, he had sworn to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” and thus he “should not violate them.” However, Lincoln claimed unilateral authority to suspend the writ because it was done during a time when Congress was unavailable to share that power.

Chief Justice Taney, riding circuit, issued a Writ of Habeas Corpus to the commander of the fort, instructing him to deliver Merryman to the circuit court in Baltimore on May 27, 1862. The commander, on Lincoln’s orders, refused to bring Merryman to the courtroom. Taney issued an opinion stating that Merryman was entitled to liberty, but he lacked the authority and capacity to enforce his order. Some argue that Lincoln’s defiance of Taney’s order was wrong—that Lincoln did not have the authority to suspend the Writ of Habeas Corpus. Yet, the legal issue was resolved when Congress enacted the Habeas Corpus Act of 1863, which covered Lincoln’s suspension with retroactive authorization, making his act constitutional after the fact.   Chief Justice Taney assumed that the judiciary has the last word on the meaning the Constitution. In Taney’s conception of the Court as the “ultimate interpreter,” executive defiance of a court order would introduce chaos and uncertainty, for it would reopen the argument that each branch is free to construe the Constitution for itself, particularly with respect to its own powers. Yet the example of Ex parte Merryman, both with Lincoln’s suspension of habeas corpus, and Congress’s role in its retroactive ratification of this action, shows that the president’s role, and the role of the legislature in the constitutional system are not so plainly constrained by the language of the Constitution.

The Court, in reaching this conclusion, determined that its rulings constitute the law of the land, within the meaning of the Supremacy Clause, and that the president, by virtue of his duty under Article II, to “take care that the laws are faithfully executed,” has the responsibility to enforce judicial decisions.   But the Court’s premise in Aaron has drawn fire, historically, from Presidents Jefferson, Jackson, and Lincoln, among others, who have denied they possess a duty to enforce judicial decisions with which they disagree. Their position is grounded on what is variously know as “coordinate construction” or “departmental construction” of the Constitution.

In his celebrated Inaugural Address of 1861, Lincoln denied that constitutional questions could be settled solely by the Court. If governmental policy on “vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed” by the Supreme Court, “the people will have ceased to be their own rulers.” The president and Congress, he explained, were entitled to exercise their own independent constitutional judgments, even if at odds with previous Court rulings. Lincoln was consistent on this point. In his famous debates with Stephen Douglas in the 1858 Senate campaign, Lincoln said that he accepted the decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford, decided a year before, but only with respect to its impact on the particular litigants. Lincoln was opposed to the extension of slavery to new territories and rejected the Court’s ruling as a basis for nationalizing slavery.  Lincoln’s advocacy of departmentalism was shared by Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Jefferson’s observations about constitutional interpretation were triggered by the justly maligned Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. In 1804, a year after Marbury v. Madison, he wrote to his frequent correspondent, Abigail Adams: “You seem to think it devolved on the judges to decide on the validity of the sedition law. But nothing in the Constitution has given them a right to decide for the Executive, more than to the Executive to decide for them.” The theory of “coordinate construction,” Jefferson explained, meant that each branch was “equally independent in the sphere of action assigned to them.” Thus, judges might sentence people to prison, and fine them, but the president, he noted, could exercise his pardon power and “remit the execution of it.” In anticipation of Lincoln, Jefferson declared that the act of vesting in the judiciary the exclusive authority to decide a constitutional question “would make the judiciary a despotic branch. “   ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_144","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_144","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_144","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_144","title":"Lincoln’s Inaugural Address of 1861 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_145","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_145","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_77","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_77","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17479","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17511","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_previous_98","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_98","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19480","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19505","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_99","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_99","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19559","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19584","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide16189","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Duty to Interpret the Constitution","thumbnail":"dr/Slide16189_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si16223","si16225","Text_Caption_126","Text_Caption_127","Image_144","Text_Caption_144","Image_145","Button_77","si17479","si17511","btn_previous_98","si19480","si19505","btn_next_99","si19559","si19584"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide16189"}}},{"id":"si19901","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si19903","class":"TODO::Senthil","title":" ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"si19918","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_45","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_45","title":"Presidential Independence from the Courts ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_159","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_159","title":"The President as Constitutional Interpreter ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_160","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_160","title":"Produced by the Robert H.

Federalist judges, however, declined to rule against statutes enacted by a Federalist Congress and signed into law by President John Adams. When Jefferson assumed the presidency, he pardoned those convicted of violating the law. Congress later reimbursed those who had been fined under the Sedition Act, which it declared “unconstitutional, null and void.” While the Supreme Court was never presented with the opportunity to rule on the Sedition Act, it did in passing, in New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), observe that while the act never came before a court of law, it was rebuked by the “court of history.”      President Andrew Jackson, like Jefferson, was an advocate of departmental construction. In 1832, Jackson vetoed a bill to recharter the Bank of the United States on both policy and constitutional grounds. He did this despite the fact that members of Congress had urged him to sign the measure since the constitutionality of the Bank had been upheld by the Supreme in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) and approved by previous presidents and congresses. In his veto message, Jackson advanced the theory of coordinate construction: Each official who takes an oath to support the Constitution, “swears that he will support it as he understands it, and not as it is understood by others.” Like Jefferson and Lincoln, Jackson announced that the opinion of judges had “no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges, and on that point the President is independent of both.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_134","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_134","title":"McCulloch v.

The question of “finality” with respect to determining the meaning the Constitution, the question of who might as the “ultimate arbiter” on constitutional matters, is of great moment. The stakes, both near and long term, are high. For their part, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton considered judicial review a crucial mechanism in maintaining constitutional government. In Federalist No. 78, Hamilton explained that the courts were “the bulwarks against legislative encroachments.” In the First Congress, Madison declared that the courts would be “an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the Legislative or Executive.” The availability of judicial review to bring an errant president to heel or to curb an unconstitutional law that threatens 1st Amendment freedoms, surely is a vital cog in the maintenance of constitutional government. The great appellate judge, Learned Hand, said the finality of judicial review was a “necessity.” And, advocates of coordinate construction certainly have had to do some hand wringing over the implications for their position found in President Nixon’s assertion of an absolute executive privilege. But perhaps it should be recalled that whoever has the last word in interpreting the Constitution is capable of abusing its power. That is a reminder that no matter how carefully constitutions are written, that there is no substitute for having good men and women at the helm.
