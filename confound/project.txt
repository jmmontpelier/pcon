when he described the U.S. Constitution “as the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.” The delegates to the Constitutional Convention did not invent from a blank slate either Congress or the Supreme Court, precedents for which were drawn from English institutions and practices, as well as American experiences under the Continental Congress, state constitutions, and a wealth of literature. But the creation of the American Presidency affirms the enthusiasm—and wisdom—of Gladstone’s observation, for the office was unique, experimental, and marbled, drawn from the Framers’ experiences, historical impressions, theories, hopes, and fears. The concerns that they harbored, reflective of the uncertainties inherent in the creation of such an important office, were assuaged by their assumption that the first president would be George Washington. Indeed, it was the nation’s good fortune that the first incumbent was a man universally admired for his integrity, character, and judgment. His election inspired Ralph Waldo Emerson’s observation that America “had made a good start.”  The Office of the Presidency was an American original. The creation of the presidency surely warranted Gladstone’s admiration as part and parcel of the Framers’ newly minted conception of a Constitution, but for another reason as well:  It was one the United States’ greatest contributions to the world of political science.  It was unlike any other national executive in the course of human history.

The presidency was an experiment, but the ideas about executive power on the basis of which it was formed, represented an eclectic distillation of the best ideas, historical practices, and theories that influenced and shaped the American political tradition. As we shall see, the Framers’ conceptions of executive power were derived from a shared body of the thoughts and wits of historians, commentators, political theorists, and colonial, revolutionary, and early statehood experiences. While these sources left a deep imprint on the Founders’ conceptions of the role of the president, the most distinctive, immediate, and compelling rationale for the creation of a chief executive was seen in the organic weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, the country‘s first attempt at government, in effect from 1781–1789.  Few of the Founders were more alive to the flaws and deficiencies of the Articles than James Madison, whose paper, “Vices of the Political System,” drafted to persuade Americans to agree to the establishment of what would become the Philadelphia Convention, pointed an accusatory finger at the Articles. “Our situation is becoming every day more and more critical,” Madison wrote to Virginia’s Governor Edmund Randolph from the Continental Congress.  “No money comes into the federal treasury; no respect is paid to the federal authority; and people of reflection unanimously agree that the existing confederacy is tottering to its foundation.”  The British in the Northwest, the Spanish in the Southeast, various Indian tribes in the West, and pirates in the Mediterranean, who were undeterred from their predation against American ships by the lack of a navy, all posed threats to the fledgling nation’s security.

In 1782, army units stationed at Newburgh, New York, threatened mutiny over back pay. In 1783, troops ransacked arsenals in Philadelphia and forced Congress to flee to Princeton while the Pennsylvania militia put down the mutineers. Congress was incapable of devising a pay plan that was acceptable to states.  Without a reliable army, Congress could not intervene decisively in the struggles between debtors and creditors, of the sort that gave rise to Shays’ Rebellion in Massachusetts. Although both sides were restrained, the “rebellion,” which involved little bloodshed, nonetheless exploded in the consciousness of Americans and illustrated the impotence of Congress in the broad sweep of public affairs which, as Madison pointed out, was likely to doom the new nation. The event, coupled with disorders in other states, prompted men of continental vision throughout the 1780s to correspond with one another about changes that might be made in the governmental system. George Washington, in the grip of despair by virtue of the various problems that afflicted the nation, wrote to Thomas Jefferson on the eve of the Constitutional Convention, “The situation of the General Government (if it can be called a government) is shaken to its foundations and liable to be overturned by every blast—In a word, it is at an end, and unless a remedy is soon applied, anarchy and confusion will inevitably ensue.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_135","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_135","roles":{}},{"id":"btn_previous_80","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_80","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18801","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18826","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_81","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_81","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18880","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18905","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide15979","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Mutinies and Rebellions","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15979_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si16013","si16015","Text_Caption_119","Text_Caption_120","Image_135","btn_previous_80","si18801","si18826","btn_next_81","si18880","si18905"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15979"}}},{"id":"si16229","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si16231","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_41","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_41","title":"Constitutional Foundations of Executive Power ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_28","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_28","title":"A Stronger Central Government ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_126","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_126","title":"A Call for a “Governor General” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_127","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_127","title":"The correspondents’ increasing interest in a remedy—the idea of a stronger central government—included a more vigorous Congress, vested with authority to regulate interstate commerce, raise revenue for a navy to protect shipping and to promote exports, and enact a protective tariff to discourage imports of manufactures. Some of the Confederation’s problems were attributable to the absence of an executive, as seen in the need for steady administration and the enforcement of laws, essential duties that were inefficiently performed by ad hoc committees. By 1787, a growing circle of leaders among the landed, commercial, and financial interests had become convinced of the need to create an executive branch. In his correspondence with various national leaders in 1786-1787, Washington had asked them to propose ideas for a new government. Among those that deeply impressed him was the proposal submitted by Secretary of War Henry Knox and Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay, both of whom called for the creation of an executive branch headed by a “Governor General.”   But what sort of “Governor General”?

The founding generation’s objection to the term, “prerogative power,” was illustrated in the fact that it was, for them, a term of derision. Their disdain for the phrase inspired a substitute—“executive power”—a term of art introduced in the revolutionary period to provide republicans a means of discussing executive authority without having to invoke the fearsome concept of prerogative powers. Subsequent explanation will facilitate our understanding of the Founders’ aversion and distrust of executive powers, but that fear permeated the marrow of colonial thought, which believed that liberty was threatened by exclusive executive power and balanced by separating power with a legislative body. If a monarchy was unavailable to the Framers, as it surely was, then the Convention’s search for the idea of a presidency grounded in civil and secular executive power, might be found in the dissenting tradition. But as crisply and efficiently as they tore down the claims of monarchical power, a clear alternative was not readily apparent.

Beyond the initial impulse for the creation of the executive lay the repudiation of the powers of the English Crown—its sweeping powers, excesses, and imperial ways. The design of the presidency reflected republican manners, principles, and values: modest powers, sharply limited and defined.

The creation of a weak, enfeebled executive, unable to enforce the laws and administer the government, would severely undermine the capacity of government to govern. Indeed, failure to vest in the executive sufficient authority, indeed, the energy to perform the duties and responsibilities of the office would prevent the new Republic from taking flight. Thus, there was a compelling need, as Justice Joseph Story put it, to create an organization that would secure energy in the executive, without threatening the security of the people. Drawing necessary lines for both power and boundaries to power was a question of great moment for the Framers in their invention of the presidency. The great questions of the structure of the office, as well as the method of selecting or electing the president; the term of office; possible reelection, as well as the removal of the executive, if necessary; as well as the powers that would be vested in the presidency, were complex matters that required careful attention to detail and considerable vision.

This understanding precludes resort to the claim of extra-constitutional powers, that is, authority not derived from, or grounded in, the Constitution.

Protection for liberty was better served, they believed, through more precise definitions of power, so that officeholders and citizens alike might be better informed about the allocation of authority because they could see it expressed in the text.

Arguments about the meaning or scope of these powers certainly persist, and there is room for disagreement about the contours and parameters of authority. Our analysis includes key components from the illuminating discussions and debates in Philadelphia, but it will also explore debates about presidential power in the contemporary world.  Apart from the enumeration of presidential powers, there remain important questions, long the subject of public interest and academic debate. Does the president possess, by virtue of Article II, powers variously called inherent, emergency, or prerogative powers? If so, is that authority found in the Vesting Clause, that is, the first sentence of Article II: “The executive Power shall be vested in a President”? If not, is it located in another clause? Moreover, does the president enjoy “implied powers” that are derived from the enumerated or express powers outlined in Article II? We will explore these questions, and more, in the remaining modules of this course.

Whatever else the phrase “executive power” might mean or indicate, it is a given that it refers, at a minimum, to the duty of the president to enforce the law and make some appointments to office. One of the principal motives behind the invention of the presidency was, in fact, the need for an Administrator in Chief, an omission in the Articles of Confederation that undercut governmental efficiency and enforcement of laws. Of course, the president cannot personally enforce the laws, a duty that is spelled out in the Take Care Clause of Article II, and which implies the creation of an organization or administration to facilitate that responsibility.

This view of the subject will at once suggest to us the intimate connection between the duration of the executive magistrate in office and the stability of the system of administration.”    The Framers’ determination to establish the president as chief administrator was largely a reaction to the omission of such an office under the Articles of Confederation, as well as a common sense recognition of the need for an administrative organization that could enforce the laws, programs, and policies of Congress. In this context the president was acting as an agent of Congress, a relationship that becomes far more complicated later, when authorizations of executive discretion become a commonplace of congressional behavior. Thus the president’s duties and responsibilities would hinge on congressional action in creating and repealing departments, offices, laws, and policies.
