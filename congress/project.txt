Inclusion of the president in making legislation brings to bear the concept of the collective wisdom of the two political branches in enacting the laws that govern the nation. From the beginning, delegates to the Constitutional Convention were committed to entrusting the newly minted president with the authority to veto bills presented by Congress, but there was some debate over the question of whether the power should be absolute or qualified. James Wilson, for example, feared that without an absolute veto, that Congress could “at any moment sink” the executive into “non-existence.” Alexander Hamilton shared Wilson’s perspective. But the wise old man of the Convention—Benjamin Franklin—drew upon his experience in Pennsylvania and reminded his colleagues that the governor had used his veto authority to “extort money.”  The governor was corrupt; he had often demanded an increase in his salary, or “some donation” in return for his approval of a bill. Roger Sherman agreed with Franklin. He was opposed to allowing a single man to thwart the will of the legislature: “No one man could be found so far above all the rest in wisdom.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_176","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_176","title":"Resolution 8, Monday June 4 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_138","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_138","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_141","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_141","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_71","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_71","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17992","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18018","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_previous_123","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_123","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23868","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23893","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_124","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_124","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23947","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23972","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide15806","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Debates in the Convention on the Veto Power","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15806_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si15840","si15842","Text_Caption_115","Text_Caption_116","Text_Caption_176","Image_138","Image_141","Button_71","si17992","si18018","btn_previous_123","si23868","si23893","btn_next_124","si23947","si23972"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15806"}}},{"id":"si15920","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si15922","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_38","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_38","title":"Checks On and By Congress ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","title":"Opposition to the Absolute Veto ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_117","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_117","title":"Federalist  No. 73 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_118","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_118","title":"Most of the Framers were strongly opposed to the concept of an absolute veto, which smacked of the King’s prerogative powers. But they recognized the wisdom of empowering the president to block or veto measures which were unconstitutional, unwise, and injurious to the public welfare. Hamilton, in Federalist No. 73, pointed out “the insufficiency of a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries” of each branch and the necessity of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its defence.” They perceived the veto as intrinsically negative in character. After all, it is essentially a power to prevent the passage of legislation. But they also viewed the veto power as a revisionary power—a positive mechanism for persuading Congress to reconsider its legislation under threat of a presidential veto and to alter provisions of measures to win the president’s support.   At all events, the veto power was qualified by empowering Congress to override a presidential rejection of a bill presented to him. The question of the appropriate percentage of members necessary to override a presidential veto was a matter that occasioned discussion and debate. Initially, a two-thirds vote in each chamber was required. Then, as a means of protecting the executive veto, the percentage went up to three-fourths. Soon, it was back to two-thirds.

George Washington invoked it only twice during his two terms in office—once on constitutional grounds and once because he thought the bill presented to him was carelessly drafted. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did not use the veto. The explanation for the absence of vetoes during their terms in office, a combined 16 years, is to be seen in the fact that they enjoyed majorities in Congress and influence in shaping legislation. In the first 28 years of the American presidency, the veto power was exercised only seven times.   Beginning with Andrew Jackson, however, presidents began to invoke the veto power much more frequently. Jackson exercised use of the veto 12 times, which evoked anger and frustration in Congress. Jackson’s veto of the national bank bill in 1832 infuriated legislators and became the pivotal issue in the presidential election. Jackson was pushed to sign the bill into law, but he refused, despite the fact that the national bank had been established by the First Congress in 1791, and supported by Congress for the next three decades, and supported by previous presidents and the Supreme Court in the landmark case of McCulloch v. Maryland (1819). He maintained his right to determine the wisdom and constitutionality of the bill, irrespective of what his predecessors had said. In terms familiar to students of the presidency and the Constitution, Jackson anticipated Abraham Lincoln, in invoking the principle of departmental construction, and said that each public official takes an oath to uphold the Constitution, “as he understands it, and not as it is understood by others.” Jackson conceded no grounds of superiority to interpretations advanced by either Congress or the judiciary.

Historically, few presidential vetoes have been overridden. Indeed, only about four percent of all vetoed bills have become law since the founding of the nation.  Franklin D. Roosevelt holds the record for the most vetoes, rejecting a total of 635 bills in his four terms in the White House.

President George Washington, the presiding officer at the Constitutional Convention, stated, “From the nature of the Constitution, I must approve all parts of a Bill, or reject it in toto.”  But since the 1840s, various political actors have urged attribution to the president of an item veto power which, depending on its definition, would permit the deletion or veto of parts of legislation or specific expenditures within an appropriation bill.   The first codification of the item veto occurred in the Confederate Constitution of 1861, by which the Confederate president was authorized to veto parts of appropriations bills. President Jefferson Davis vetoed 38 bills, but he never invoked the item veto power. In the aftermath of the Civil War, various states adopted for their governors the authority to exercise the line item veto. By 1920, 37 states had adopted the item veto. The widespread attraction of the item veto lay in its perceived remedy for the corruption and the irresponsible spending practices among state legislatures.  President Ulysses S. Grant admired, and envied, the item veto possessed by state chief executives and, in his fifth State of the Union Message on December 1, 1873, became the first president to ask for it. He, too, believed it would aid the president in his effort to curb the abuse and waste of government funds. Since then, a parade of presidents—of both parties—have sought the item veto.

Theodore Roosevelt expressed a fanciful wish:  “Oh, if I could be President and Congress too, for just ten minutes.” The truth is, as John F. Kennedy remarked: “It is much easier in many ways for me when Congress is not in town.” Congress insists on being a partner in the legislative process, which explains why significant parts of executive programs are reduced to ribbon cuttings. For example, much of Kennedy’s New Frontier and Richard Nixon’s New American Revolution were lost to squabbles between the two branches. Lyndon Johnson enjoyed considerable support from Congress and, as a consequence, considerable legislative success, but he, too, faced setbacks from a Congress that he supposedly dominated. His tax program, for example, was delayed, and the Senate defeated his nomination of a Supreme Court justice.  Members of Congress insist on being partners in the legislative process—as they should. But they also look to the president to provide strong legislative leadership, in large measure because Congress is not particularly good at developing and passing comprehensive programs when left on its own. Presidents are well positioned to introduce measures, develop them, deal with opposition, and articulate their merits to the American public as a means of securing popular support.

The expanding role of the federal government and the emergence on the national scene of an energetic executive like Roosevelt, who relished the opportunity of placing his hands on all of the issues, produced an increased executive role in legislation to govern increasingly complex problems. The president, Roosevelt reminded legislators, was the only national officer in the American governmental configuration, and only the Chief Executive could marshal the formidable economic, technological, and social forces necessary to achieving solutions to these challenges. Congress seemed to acquiescence in the conclusion that it was ill-equipped to handle these issues and it deferred to the president. Congress, it was said, was better positioned to handling issues that could be broken down into district or state lines, than those that escaped constituency boundaries. With that concession, an energetic presidency was launched on a trajectory that would dramatically change the dynamics of power between the legislative and executive branches. Roosevelt pushed through Congress The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, as well as the program for the creation of a national park system, programs that cut across several traditional classes of private and public interests. Roosevelt’s cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, elevated the concept of the president as legislative leader to even greater heights in the perilous period of his presidency. Indeed, Roosevelt’s presidency became the model for the contemporary presidency.

On June 10, 1963, President Kennedy signed into law a bill that provided for equal pay for equal work, thus seemingly bringing to fruition a long legislative effort, dating back to the Civil War, to prohibit pay discrimination on gender grounds. Kennedy had advocated for passage of the bill over the objections of business interests and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which believed that female employees would be more expensive than men. But Kennedy was committed to the principle of equality in “pay envelopes.”  Despite enactment of the principle of “equal pay for equal work,” however, and despite the fact that women constitute roughly 66% of the work force, governmental statistics reveal that women still earn only 77 cents on the dollar paid to men. On January 29, 2009, President Barack Obama, a strong champion of the principle of equal pay for women, signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Equal Pay Act, which provided that the 180-day statute of limitations that governs an equal pay lawsuit for discrimination resets with each paycheck. That revision was necessary to overcome a Supreme Court ruling in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. (2007), which held that the statute of limitations begins when the employer makes the initial discriminatory wage decision, not the date of the most recent paycheck.

Eisenhower, where the concept was initially proposed.  Presidential advocacy of Medicare represents a case study in executive leadership, including executive guidance in Congress in shaping and developing policy, working political connections through lobbying, and public promotion of the program. Medicare was a key part of President Kennedy’s New Frontier program, and it met great obstacles that prevented its enactment under his administration. It was, perhaps, the most difficult part of his program to enact, principally because the American Medical Association launched a huge, expensive, and bitter campaign to defeat it in Congress. On June 17, 1962, the Senate defeated the bill by a narrow margin. There was no action on the bill through much of 1963, but in November 1963, just days before the assassination of President Kennedy, Rep. Wilbur Mills, whose support was critical in his capacity of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, struck an agreement with the Kennedy Administration on a financing formula.

ArticleII, Section 1 provides that in case the president is removed from office because of death, resignation, or inability to discharge official duties, “the Same shall devolve on the Vice President . . . .”   The principal reference to the office, however, appears in Article I, Section 3: “The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.”  Thus the sole constitutional function of the vice president is to preside over the Senate.

By constitutional design, the vice president is something of a hybrid, a denizen of both the legislative and executive branches. The debates in Philadelphia on the nature and purpose of the vice president reflect the challenges confronting the Framers in the construction of the office. On September 7, Elbridge Gerry opposed the assignment of the Senate duty to the vice president. He stated: “We might as well put the President himself at the head of the Legislature. The close intimacy that must subsist between the President & the vice-president makes it absolutely improper. He was agst having any vice President.” Edmund Randolph shared Gerry’s protest, as did George Mason, but for a different reason. Mason thought the office of vice president “an encroachment on the rights of the Senate,” and asserted the need to maintain the separation of powers doctrine that was evolving in the Convention.  In Federalist No. 68, Alexander Hamilton addressed, and attempted to explain away, the objection to making the vice president the president of the Senate. He argued, first, that in order to “secure” a “definite resolution of the body, it is necessary that the president should have only a casting vote.” Second, to make a particular senator the president of the Senate “would be to exchange, in regard to the State from which he came, a constant for a contingent vote.” Those are not plausible arguments for the invention of the office. In our time, various senators have assumed the duties of the presiding officer, while casting votes on bills.

Thus the Framers gave the electors two votes, but required that they cast at least one for a citizen of a different state. They probably expected that the electors’ second-choice vote would identify a national consensus president. The second office, they reasoned, would ensure that the electors voted seriously.

Their familiarity with the struggles between the Crown and Parliament influenced their allocation of powers at every turn. This was certainly true of the spending power. The Kings’ long historical practice of seeking extra-parliamentary revenue for their wars and other foreign policy adventures, in the face of Parliament’s refusal to fund their causes, contributed to the English Civil Wars in the mid-17th century. Indeed, Charles I lost both his office and his head. Later that century, King James II sought to circumvent parliamentary spending limits in soliciting foreign funds for a military initiative. Parliament was outraged by the King’s usurpation of power and, in a reaction that influenced the Framers’ configuration of the Impeachment Clause, it proceeded to impeach the King’s loyal Treasury Ministry.

Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution provides: “No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” In Federalist No. 58, Madison explained that “the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people.” The grant to Congress of the power over the purse is reflected, moreover, in other provisions of Article I, Section 9, which vest in the legislature the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and coin money and regulate its value.  The republican principle that separated the power of the purse and the sword was a cornerstone of the Framers’ philosophy. Thus, they divided the power of funding war from the power to conduct it. Congress, alone, possessed the authority to finance war. The president, as Commander in Chief, had the duty of conducting it, subject to congressional instructions. In the Convention, George Mason stated: “the purse and the sword ought never to get into the same hands whether Legislative or Executive.” Madison reiterated the importance of lodging in the same hands the decision to go to war and the power to finance it, while separating those two powers and functions from the role played by the president as Commander in Chief: “Those who are to conduct a war cannot in the nature of things, be proper or safe judges, whether a war ought to be commenced, continued or concluded.

President Reagan had made very clear his support of the Contras, publicly likening them to the American colonists during the revolutionary period. Those measures appeared to be insufficient and so Congress in 1984, passed the Boland Amendments, which strictly prohibited all U.S. support—of any kind—for the Contras.   But the president’s enthusiasm for the Contras led members of Congress to suspect that the administration was seeking, or might seek, means of aiding and assisting the Contras. In the course of congressional hearings in the spring of 1985, administration witnesses testified that there were no efforts—public or private—to aid the Contras. At that very moment, however, when administration witnesses were offering assurances to two congressional committees, executive officials were, indeed, actively soliciting funds to aid the Contras. Private citizens and the government of Saudi Arabia were contributing money to purchase military weapons and supplies for the Contras.

Those critical moments shaped the Philadelphia Convention’s design of the Impeachment Clause.   Of all of the revelations to emerge from the Iran-Contra Affair, one of the most alarming was the Reagan Administration’s theory that Congress could not use its power of the purse to restrict the president in foreign affairs. As a consequence, the exercise of the appropriations power, implemented through statutory restraints, was subordinate to the will of the president, who is free to search abroad for funds to support programs prohibited by American law. The Reagan Administration destroyed official documents related to the Iran-Contra Affair. As a result, we may never know whether President Reagan authorized the support of the Contras, in violation of statutes enacted by Congress. But if he had, he would have committed an impeachable offense by combining the power of the purse, with the power of the sword, an act which James Madison decried as a violation of a foundational principle of republicanism.

Both Presidents Jefferson and Lincoln faced crises that compelled them to spend money from the U.S. Treasury, while Congress was not in session, as means necessary to the defense of the nation. In 1807, a British vessel fired on the American ship, The Chesapeake, while Congress was in recess. Without authorization from Congress, Jefferson ordered a variety of military purchases, and then informed Congress what he had done, when it returned. As we have seen from a previous discussion, Jefferson sought, and received from Congress retroactive ratification for his expenditures. In 1861, after the firing on Fort Sumter and while Congress was in recess, Lincoln spent money from the Treasury for military and naval measures. On July 4, when Congress returned, Lincoln explained his actions, and Congress provided retroactive approval. Without that approval, Lincoln’s acts would have remained illegal—and unconstitutional—and he might have faced censure or, worse, impeachment.

Since the days of George Washington, presidents have not been required to spend every dollar appropriated by Congress. Where contingency funds are involved, presidents have discretionary authority to exercise discretion and not spend all of the money allocated. In 1803, Jefferson withheld $50,000 of funds allocated for the purchase of gunboats. Congress understood his rationale for impounding funds. As he explained it, the Louisiana Purchase had rendered unnecessary the expenditure of funds for such military measures.  The impoundment of funds, however, may not interfere with the authority of Congress to determine budget and policy priorities. Typically, Congress will not object to a presidential decision to impound funds in the name of economy and fiscal prudence, but abandonment of a congressional program crosses the line. Presidents of both parties, from the 1940s through the 1960s, frequently impounded funds allocated for defense and military matters. Harry Truman, for example, impounded Air Force funds and canceled a super carrier. When conflicts arose, political accommodations were made; litigation and crises were avoided.

He impounded funds allocated for numerous programs, including the Rural Environmental Assistance Program, the Water Bank Program, the emergency loan program of the Farmers Home Administration and the Rural Electrification Administration, rural water and sewer grants, housing projects, and other federal programs. The largest amount of funding impounded by Nixon was $18 billion from the clean water program, exactly 50 percent of what Congress had allocated over a three-year period.  Nixon’s capacious understanding of impoundment generated dozens of lawsuits, asserting that the president had usurped congressional authority. Federal courts delivered roughly 80 decisions on Nixon’s theories of impoundment authority. The administration lost in all but three cases. In 1975, the Supreme Court, in Train v. City of New York, also rejected Nixon’s theories. As a result of these matters, some pressure was building to impeach Nixon on these grounds even before the Watergate scandal arose.

Under this statute, the president was ordered to submit reports to Congress on two types of impoundment: rescissions, which are proposals to terminate funds, and deferrals, which are proposals to delay the expenditure of funds. For a rescission, the president requires the support of both houses of Congress through a regular bill or a joint resolution. The statute provides that the president must obtain that support within 45 days of continuous session. Under that measure, moreover, either house of Congress could pass a resolution to disapprove deferrals, but that type of legislative veto was held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in INS v. Chadha (1983). As a consequence of that ruling, deferrals are now limited to managerial actions. Presidents are thus barred from impounding funds merely because they disagree with congressional policies.
