government a series of specific foreign affairs powers, responsibilities, and duties. The relatively lean text, and the fact that it omits mention of particular powers has no doubt contributed to the constitutional tension, controversy, and occasional crises that have marked American foreign affairs. Nevertheless, the Constitution vests in Congress the bulk of the nation’s foreign policy powers, a design that assigns to Congress senior status in a partnership with the president for the formulation, management, and conduct of U.S. foreign policy.   This arrangement, however, has been challenged in the 20th century by assertions of unilateral presidential power that have laid the basis for an increasingly energetic executive in the area of foreign affairs. To understand the constitutional allocation of foreign affairs powers, it is necessary to examine the Constitution—the text, its design, the intentions of the Framers, its history, and its subsequent interpretations.

This assignment reflects  the overwhelming preference of the Framers at the Constitutional Convention and the Ratifiers in the various state ratifying conventions for collective decision-making in foreign as well as domestic affairs. This constitutional arrangement is evidenced by specific textual knowledge, little in the way of debate by Framers and Ratifiers, and by structural inferences from the doctrine of separation of powers. The design, moreover, is compelling and relevant for 21st-century America for at least three reasons. For one, separation of powers issues are perennial, for they require consideration of the proper repository of power. Contemporary questions about the allocation of power between the president and Congress in foreign affairs are largely the same as those addressed two centuries ago. For another, the logic of collective decision-making in the realm of foreign relations is as sound today as it was during the Founding period. And, although it is true that the world and the role of the United States in international relations have changed considerably over the past 200 years, it is nevertheless the case that most questions of foreign affairs simply involve routine policy formulation. A more detailed understanding of the constitutional landscape and the values that characterize it would prove beneficial both to government officials, who must forge policy in light of the constitutional design for foreign affairs, and to citizens, who engage in critiques of those policies.

Congress has the power to “declare war” and to “grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal” as well as to develop rules regarding “Captures on Land and Water.” Congress also possesses the authority to raise, support, and maintain an Army and Navy, to “make Rules” for the regulation and government of the “land and naval Forces” and to call forth “the militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel Invasions.” It also assigns to Congress the power and responsibility to organize, arm, discipline, and govern the militia.

Specifically, the president is granted the authority “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.” Another provision, Article VI— the “Supremacy Clause”— makes treaties, along with the Constitution and acts of Congress, “the supreme law of the land.” The constitutional authority of the president to “appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls” is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.  The Constitution assigns to the president only two exclusive roles in foreign affairs. Article II provides that the president is Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy but, as we have seen, he acts in this capacity by and under the authority of Congress.

And the president also has the power to receive ambassadors. The “Reception Clause,” or “Recognition Power,” will be explained in detail later, but James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson agreed that this clerk-like function was ceremonial in character. Although the function has come to entail recognition of states in international law (thus the “recognition” power), which carries with it certain legal implications, this Founding trio contended that the power of recognizing states was a “duty,” devoid of discretionary authority, and more conveniently placed in the hands of the executive than in the legislature. This list exhausts the textual grant of authority with respect to foreign affairs jurisdiction. The president’s constitutional powers are few and modest, and pale in comparison with those vested in Congress.  The judiciary is assigned constitutional power that bears on the conduct of foreign policy. Article III, Section 2, confers upon the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in “all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls,” while it generally lodges in the federal courts jurisdiction in “controversies between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_79","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_79","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22145","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22170","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_80","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_80","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22224","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22249","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide16117","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Constitutional Division of Foreign Affairs Powers","thumbnail":"dr/Slide16117_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si16202","Text_Caption_126","Text_Caption_127","Text_Caption_128","btn_previous_79","si22145","si22170","btn_next_80","si22224","si22249"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide16117"}}},{"id":"si16372","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si16374","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_41","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_41","title":"Head of State ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_29","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_29","title":"Constitutional Prohibitions on Foreign Affairs Powers ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_133","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_133","title":"Federalism Irrelevant in Foreign Affairs ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_134","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_134","title":"The Constitution also imposes some significant and specific prohibitions, the effect of which is to ensure that control over foreign relations is vested in the national government. For purposes of foreign relations, federalism is virtually irrelevant. Bulked by the Supremacy Clause, federal acts are supreme and require the acquiescence of states. In United States v. Belmont (1937), the Supreme Court observed: “In respect of our foreign relations generally, state lines disappear. As to such purposes the State . . . does not exist.” Thus, Article I, Section 10, categorically forbids states from entering “into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation.” Moreover, no state may, without the consent of Congress, “enter into any Agreement or Compact . . . with a foreign power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded,” or in “imminent danger” of invasion. Other prohibitions touch upon the conduct of foreign affairs, although none of them in practice is very important. Thus, Article I, Section 9, provides that no holder of any “Office of Profit or Trust” under the United States may “accept of any present, Emolument, Office or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign state,” without the consent of Congress.

Instead, he maintained, before the Revolution, general power had been lodged in the British Crown. But with the Declaration of Independence, “the power of external sovereignty had passed . . . to the colonies in their collective and corporate capacity as the United States.” The power over foreign affairs was “older than the Constitution” and had been inherited by the newly formed “Union” from the Confederation. It did not depend upon any direct grant of authority from the Constitution, for it is a necessary attribute of nationhood and sovereignty. Not only did the foreign affairs powers inhere in the Union, but it belonged to the president, who would exercise “plenary” power in his capacity as the “sole organ” of American foreign policy (a concept explained at length later), although the opinion did not explain how such authority came to belong to the executive.

Through Article 9, for example, states delegated the war and treaty powers. That grant alone undermines Sutherland’s premise that these powers were derived from a source other than the states. Moreover, even if it were assumed that the power of external sovereignty had been by some method transferred directly form the Crown to the union, it remains to be explained why that power would be vested in the president.

[they] will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce.” Thus the foreign affairs powers are tethered to the Constitution.

Second, without authority to regulate foreign commerce, Congress lacked bargaining power in its attempt to strike favorable trade agreements.  Third, and most important, Congress had no power to prevent states from violating treaties negotiated in the name of the United States, which meant that individual states could undermine the reputation, integrity, and security of the nation.   Indeed, the pervasive infidelity of the states to the international obligations and treaty agreements of the United States subverted the ability of the union to maintain its foreign credit and position as a sovereign nation. The frequent treaty violations, according to James Madison, justly known as the Father of the Constitution for his role as its chief architect, constituted one of the principal “vices of the political system of the United States.” They led Alexander Hamilton to lament in Federalist No. 22: “The faith, the reputation, the peace of the whole Union, are thus continually at the mercy of the prejudices, the passions, and the interests of every member of which it is composed.

While the Supremacy Clause certainly had profound implications for areas other than diplomacy, there is no exaggeration in the observation that it provided the sine qua non of a vital and vibrant national foreign policy.  The Articles of Confederation also supplied, in some key respects, a point of departure. The Articles had vested executive as well as legislative authority in Congress. Article 6 granted Congress control over the conduct of foreign policy, and Article 9 granted it “the sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war.” But the Philadelphia Convention had embraced the principle of separation of powers, and now the delegates were forced to fashion a division of authority between the legislative and executive branches.

The authority to regulate foreign commerce is a shared by both houses of Congress and the president. The construction of the treaty power affirms the theme of collective decision-making.

To the contrary, all of the arguments of the Framers and Ratifiers were to the effect that the Senate and the president, which Madison and Hamilton described as a “fourth branch of government” in their capacity as treaty maker, “are to manage all our concerns with foreign nations.” Although a number of factors contributed to this decision, the pervasive fear of unbridled executive power loomed largest. Hamilton’s statement in Federalist No. 75 fairly represents these sentiments: “The history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind, as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world, to the sole disposal of a magistrate created and circumstanced as would be a President of the United States.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_95","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_95","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23409","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23434","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_96","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_96","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23488","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23513","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide16893","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Embodying the Principle of Collective Decision-making","thumbnail":"dr/Slide16893_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si16927","Text_Caption_148","Text_Caption_149","Text_Caption_150","btn_previous_95","si23409","si23434","btn_next_96","si23488","si23513"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide16893"}}},{"id":"si17014","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_49","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_49","title":"Head of State ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_37","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_37","title":"The English Model of Unfettered Authority ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_151","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_151","title":"Federative Power ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_152","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_152","title":"The Framers might have adopted the English or Executive model, for reasons of familiarity, tradition, and simplicity, as a means of promoting and securing its vaunted values of unity, secrecy and dispatch—but they did not.

Locke warned that the separation of executive and federative powers would invite “disorder and ruin.” Sir William Blackstone, the great 18th-century jurist, explained in his magisterial four-volume Commentaries on the Law of England, that the King exercised plenary authority over all matters relating to war and peace, diplomacy, treaties, and military command. Blackstone defined the King’s prerogative as “those rights and capacities, which the King enjoys alone.” The Monarch’s prerogatives, “those which are rooted in and spring from the King’s political person,” include the authority to send and receive ambassadors and the power to make war or peace. The King, moreover, could negotiate “a treaty with a foreign state, which shall irrevocably bind the nation,” and he could issue letters of marque and reprisal, which authorized private citizens to perform military actions on behalf of the nation. According to Blackstone, the King was “the generalizing, or the first in military command,” and he possessed “the sole power of raising and regulating fleets and armies.” Blackstone explained that in the exercise of this lawful prerogative, the King “is, and ought to be absolute; that is, so far absolute that there is no legal authority that can either delay or resist him.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_97","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_97","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23567","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23592","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_98","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_98","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23646","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si23671","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide16980","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The English Model of Unfettered Authority","thumbnail":"dr/Slide16980_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si17014","Text_Caption_151","Text_Caption_152","Text_Caption_153","btn_previous_97","si23567","si23592","btn_next_98","si23646","si23671"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide16980"}}},{"id":"si17101","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si17103","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_50","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_50","title":"Head of State ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_38","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_38","title":"The Convention Rejects the English Model ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_155","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_155","title":"The Convention’s rejection of the English model and Locke’s admonitions could not have been more emphatic. The Framers’ blueprint for foreign affairs reflects their determination to establish a republic which, as we have seen, is grounded on collective decision-making, a principle that reflects confidence in the crossfire of discussion and debate as a method for producing superior laws, policies, and programs. The Framers’ rejection of the executive model was equally rooted in their deep aversion to unrestrained, unilateral executive power and their commitment to the republican principle of collective decision-making, that the conjoined wisdom of the many is superior to that of one. The Framers perceived a broad equatorial divide between the hemispheres of monarchism and republicanism, between the values of the Old World and the New World. The Framers’ deliberate fragmentation of powers relating to diplomacy, treaties, and war and peace, and the allocation of the various foreign affairs powers to different departments and agencies of government reflected their determination to apply the doctrines of separation of powers and checks and balances, the principle of the rule of law, and the elements of constitutionalism to the realm of foreign relations as rigorously as they had been applied to the domestic domain. The grant of limited constitutional powers in foreign affairs to the president, in contrast to the sweeping discretionary prerogatives possessed by the King, laid bare the historic transformation wrought by the Framers. Most conspicuous, of course, was the Convention’s decision to subject the president to impeachment, a decisive move that broke from the fiction indulged in England that the King could no wrong. Among the offenses adjudged worthy of impeachment, the Framers determined, was executive abuse of foreign affairs powers. James Iredell, a delegate to the North Carolina Ratifying Convention, and a future U.S. Supreme Court justice, observed that “if the President tried to make a treaty without the Senate, he would be impeached.” Manifestly, if the president were to have possessed the blanket authority in the realm of foreign policy enjoyed by the King, he could not have been subjected to the congressional power of impeachment.

In Federalist No. 47, James Madison observed that “treaties with foreign sovereigns” assume, once they are made, “the force of legislative acts.” The Constitution, moreover, characterizes the power to declare war as legislative and the power to conduct it as executive. The judiciary assumes a role in foreign affairs as well since the Supremacy Clause imposes upon judges the duty to enforce treaties as the law of the land.

It is explicable, though, in terms of their intellectual orientation, their understanding of history, and their own practical experiences. The effective control and management of foreign policy and the use of armed force was, of course, a primary goal and driving force behind the Convention. Indeed, given the widespread ramifications of foreign relations, “nothing,” as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., has observed, “was more crucial for the new nation than the successful conduct of its external relations.” The difficult search for an efficient foreign policy design was complicated by the Framers’ heightened fear of the abuse of power. They were steeped in English history and they well knew that the “management of foreign relations,” as Madison stated, “appears to be the most susceptible of abuse of all trusts committed to a Government . . . .” War alone could plunder the nation’s treasury, ravage its society, and, of course, destroy its very lifeblood. The Framers contemplated the possibility and consequences of treasonous acts, realized that fortunes were to be made in the dark and secretive world of espionage, and feared the “loss of liberty at home” that might result from “danger, real or pretended, from abroad.” They were also greatly influenced by the stresses and strains inflicted by the constitutional crisis and political convulsions of the 17th-century English Civil Wars. The absolutist claims of the Stuart Kings and the abuse of power by manipulative ministers had hardened their view toward the executive. The pervasive fear of unbridled authority and the specter of an embryonic monarch precluded presidential control of foreign affairs.

The Framers’ attachment to collective judgment—joint participation, consultation, and concurrence—and their decision to create a structure of shared powers in foreign affairs, in the words of James Wilson, “produced a security to the people.” The emphasis on collective decision-making came at the expense of unilateral executive authority, of course, but that consequence was of little moment, given the Founders’ overriding aversion to unrestrained executive power. But that was the point, precisely. The Framers contrived a new constitutional arrangement for foreign affairs, a distinctively American contribution to politics and political science, and it was epitomized in their judgment that, in the newly-minted Republican Era, the executive unilateralism exalted by prevailing models was a shopworn, outdated method that belonged to an age and means of governance that they had rejected and discarded.

Roosevelt, to impose an arms embargo on Bolivia and Paraguay, then involved in the Chaco War, if he determined that the embargo “may contribute to the reestablishment of peace” between the belligerents.

Robbins had been charged with murder. Since the case was working its way through the American legal system, Adams’s critics called for his impeachment on grounds that he had encroached on the power of the judiciary and violated the separation of powers doctrine. Marshall defended Adams’ decision. Adams, he said, was merely executing a treaty; he was not making policy, but merely implementing it. Adams, Marshall said, was acting under express language of a treaty which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution, is part of the “supreme Law of the Land.” Marshall noted that the “President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations...

Seeman (1801), Marshall held that “the whole powers of war” are assigned by the Constitution to Congress. And, in Little v.

On the contrary, the treaty-making power, vested in the president and the Senate, is the embodiment of the Framers’ preference for collective decision-making in the formulation, conduct, and management of American foreign policy. In fact, the Framers envisioned the treaty power as the principal vehicle for the conduct of the nation’s foreign affairs, a veritable “fourth branch of government,” in the words of James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. Speaking of the prominent role assigned to the Senate, Hamilton told his colleagues in the New York Ratifying Convention that “They, together with the President, are to manage all our concerns with foreign nations.”   As late as August 7, 1787, the draft constitution excluded the president from both the treaty-making and appointment powers, which were lodged, exclusively, in the Senate. Clearly, there was no movement afoot to create either an “imperial presidency” or an executive-driven foreign policy apparatus. On August 23, the Convention considered for the first time the recommendation of the Committee of Detail that “the Senate shall have power to make treaties.” Madison noted in the discussion that because the Senate represented “the states alone,” that “the President should be an agent in Treaties.” In his recommendation, Madison believed that the president should be an agent for the Senate in making treaties. Madison recognized that treaty making involved executive functions exercised in subordination to the Senate. It is likely that Madison was drawing on the experience of Congress under the Articles of Confederation. While Congress possessed the sole power of making treaties, it created the office of Secretary of Foreign Affairs—an executive officer—to carry out Senate policies during treaty negotiations.

For different reasons, Madison and Morris were uncomfortable with the idea of vesting the treaty power in the Senate alone. At the core of their concerns lay the fear that, as a result of the “Great Compromise” of July 16, which gave the states equal representation in the Senate, that the Senate would become a battleground for states’ rights interests, sectional interests, and economic interests, that would prevail over and, perhaps, overwhelm the national interests. Without a role for the House of Representatives, Morris argued, the Senate, alone, might make a treaty requiring “all the rice of South Carolina” to be sent to a single foreign port. James Wilson, another delegate from Pennsylvania, supported Morris by arguing that the Senate could sell out the interests of a state or a section of the country, as in a Senate striking an agreement with a foreign nation to abandon western interests in navigation on the Mississippi or the fishing interests of New England. The discussion revealed a great deal of uncertainty among the delegates. Madison, for example, wondered aloud whether both houses ought to be involved in the making of commercial treaties while “the President & Senate” should jointly make treaties of peace. No one commented on Madison’s remark, prescient as it was, and the Convention remanded the question of the treaty power to the Committee of the Whole for further consideration.

There, Hamilton proposed that the “supreme Executive” would “have with the advice and approbation of the Senate the power of making all treaties.” That was the same speech in which Hamilton declared that the “Senate” should “have the sole power of declaring war,” and that the president should “have the ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_190","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_190","title":"direction of war when authorized or begun.” Hamilton’s view that the president should be included in diplomatic matters, but denied the authority to initiate war, captured the views of the delegates and proved influential in the Convention.   The inclusion of the president in treaty making—as a co-equal partner—did not detract from the legislative nature of the treaty power, and it did not in any way create a platform for presidential domination of American foreign policy, although it did put him in a position of leadership. Recall that Madison, on August 23, had said that “the President should be an agent in Treaties,” and that the “Grand Committee” had essentially embraced his suggestion as a means of placing a check on the authority of the Senate. But what did this design mean for presidential leadership in foreign affairs? The president might act by himself, that is independently, but he could not accomplish anything; neither could the Senate. It could advise and consent; but only the president could make a treaty, even if he required the concurrence of the Senate. The phrase, “advice and consent” signified that the president was dependent on the Senate, and vice versa.

In the latter stages of 17th-century England, no bill could become law unless it received the endorsement of both the Parliament and the Crown. The prefatory formula of the endorsement stated that a bill was enacted or made by the King “by and with the advice and consent” of the two houses of Parliament. That formula designated the legislative practice. After the Glorious Revolution in 1689, however, Parliament became supreme and the King’s role became ceremonial. The use of the formula—“By and with the consent”—in the recommendations of the Grand Committee, which the delegates in the Convention adopted, connoted the legislative nature of treaty making in the minds of the Framers. The Framers saw the treaty power as essentially legislative in character, an original meaning retained through Article VI of the Constitution—the Supremacy Clause—which makes the Constitution, laws in pursuance thereof, and treaties, the law of the land. Once made or signed by the president, a treaty becomes law, or as John Jay stated, once made, treaties “are to have the force of laws.” In Federalist No. 75, Hamilton expressed the point directly when he said that although the power of making treaties was a shared one, between the president and Senate, the treaty power “will be found to partake more of the legislative than of the executive character. . . .” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_129","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_129","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si26095","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si26120","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_130","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_130","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si26174","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si26199","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_370","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_370","title":"Federalist No. 75 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_350","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_350","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_353","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_353","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_294","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_294","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41967","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41993","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide18495","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Treaties: Legislative more than Executive","thumbnail":"dr/Slide18495_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si18529","si18531","Text_Caption_191","Text_Caption_192","btn_previous_129","si26095","si26120","btn_next_130","si26174","si26199","Text_Caption_370","Image_350","Image_353","Button_294","si41967","si41993"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide18495"}}},{"id":"si18609","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si18611","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_68","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_68","title":"Head of State ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_57","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_57","title":"The Treaty Power vs. the Appointment Power ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_193","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_193","title":"Consent=Ratification ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_194","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_194","title":"The phrase, “advice and consent,” signified in the making of treaties, as it did in the appointment power, a two-stage process.

The president makes treaties by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, but he “shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint. . . .” Regarding appointments, then, the Constitution assigns an initiative to the president, but that is not the case with the making of treaties. “Advice” required the Senate’s involvement in foreign affairs decisions and negotiations as to treaties, and its recommendation of the office or job description as to nominations. In neither case was the Senate meant to be a pro forma instrument for endorsing decisions reached by the president alone. On the contrary, “consent” indicated ratification. “Advice and consent” indicated a deliberate involvement followed, in cases of agreement, by ratification. The coextensive nature of the treaty power implies that the president and Senate, together, are to participate in all stages of treaty-making, that is, throughout the entire process of making treaties. The Framers, as we have seen, knew how to confer upon the president a singular function, as in “nominate” in the Appointments Clause. The fact that they did not provide a similar function for the president in the making of treaties, as in, “he shall negotiate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, make treaties,” speaks volumes against a reading that would separate a presidential power to negotiate a treaty from full participation by the Senate in all phases of treaty-making.

Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to invade it.” Sutherland’s position has been roundly criticized, on several grounds. Article II of the Constitution makes no mention of “negotiation,” which makes it difficult to distill from silence a plenary presidential power of negotiation. The debates in the Constitutional Convention evince no evidence of such a claim. Then, too, the act of advising is devoid of meaning if a treaty is negotiated by the president and deposited on the doorstep of the Senate without having engaged the chamber in discussions and consultation about the treaty. Advice is not given after a treaty has been negotiated and concluded. Advice, rather, is given during the process of discussion and deliberation. If the Framers had so understood advice, Article II would have provided a limited role for the Senate, one confined to mere “consent.” To put a fine point on the matter, consider that, from the time of King James I, the Crown had sought the advice and consent of Parliament in making treaties. To assume that the Framers had intended to vest the president with a power denied to the King of England, is to ignore the sweep of history: England’s repudiation of the royal prerogative, the conversion of the Kingship into a ministerial office and, finally, the development of the Treaty Clause in Philadelphia.

He advised a Senate committee that, “in all matters respecting Treaties, oral communications [to the Senate] seem indispensably necessary; because in these a variety of matters are contained, all of which not only require consideration, but some of them may undergo much discussion; to do which by written communications would be tedious without being satisfactory.” As it happened, oral communications proved to be impracticable, but Washington continued to seek the advice of the Senate by message before opening negotiations, and throughout the entire process of treaty making. But all that proved to be unworkable was oral consultation, and that was because the Senate committee, in awe of Washington, felt inhibited from the necessary debate in his presence. As a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, he well knew, and appreciated, the virtue of seeking advice from the Senate. Although the oral communications were abandoned, Washington continued to seek advice from the Senate in written form, before opening negotiations. Thus, the president sought approval from the Senate on the selection of treaty negotiations, and advice on their negotiating instructions.

James Madison and John Jay, among others, seemed to believe that treaties ought to be terminated by the president and Senate, and historically, some have. In Federalist No. 64, Jay had drawn on the structure of the treaty power, and invoked the principle of symmetrical construction in concluding that “they who make treaties may alter or cancel them.” Similarly, Madison in 1791 remarked in a letter: “That contracting parties can annul the treaty cannot, I presume be questioned, the same authority, precisely, being exercised in annulling as in making a treaty.” It seems that both Jay, the most experienced diplomat in early American history, and Madison, whose contributions to the Constitution constituted his status as the principal architect of the document, embraced the principle of symmetry: when a power is given to do an act, the power is also given to repeal the act.

Nothing less than this symmetry would have reached the concerns that lay at the core of the debate on the treaty power. The various regional interests and state jealousies necessitated a mechanical solution in which states would have an “equal voice” in the treaty power. Without it, the small states would not have agreed to confederate. It would fly in the face of these concerns, moreover, if the Framers had not intended to provide the states with a voice in the termination of treaties which, clearly, might strike at the heart of their interests. Given the intensity of the debate, it is unlikely that the states would have left the door open for another branch to ignore or sacrifice their interests. The symmetrical principle also would be consistent with the authority of the president and the Senate to affect the status of treaties at every other stage of the treaty-making process. Given the centrality of the treaty power to the formulation and conduct of American foreign policy, as conceived by the Framers, and Hamilton’s declaration to the New York Ratifying Convention that the Senate, “together with the President, are to manage all our concerns with foreign nations,” the omission of the Senate in the termination of treaties would be striking.

In his annual message to Congress on December 4, 1854, President Franklin Pierce stated that the required notice for the termination of the treaty should be given. On March 3, 1855, the Senate, in executive session, unanimously passed such a resolution. Pursuant to the resolution, President Pierce delivered notice to the government of Denmark. Senator Charles Sumner, however, subsequently questioned the authority of the termination, because it would be equivalent to a repeal of a law by the Senate alone. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, to which the question was referred, issued its report on April 7, 1856, in which it maintained the right of the Senate to authorize the delivery of notice. The report stated: “the committee entertains no doubt that where the right to terminate a treaty. . . is reserved in the treaty itself, such discretion resides in the President and Senate.” The Senate committee considered it beyond dispute that the authority to terminate a treaty was part and parcel of the authority to make a treaty.

The decision resulted in a lawsuit, Goldwater v. Carter (1979), in which the Supreme Court declined to reach the merits of the case and dismissed it as “nonjusticiable,” meaning that the case was of a type that was not appropriate for the Court to hear. President Carter relied on the Commander in Chief Clause and the sole organ doctrine as authority for his action.  Following President Richard Nixon’s overtures to the People’s Republic of China (PRC), essentially a method toward normalization of relations, President Carter completed the process in 1978 when he withdrew recognition from the Republic of China (ROC) and granted recognition to the PRC. The act of recognition, an exercise in “conditional” recognition, required the United States to terminate the 1954 Mutual Defense Treaty with the ROC, the cornerstone of American relations with Taiwan. The treaty permitted “either” party” to terminate the pact after giving the other nation one year’s notice. The treaty did not provide which U.S. department possessed constitutional authority to end the agreement. Members of Congress, concerned about the future of U.S.-Taiwan relations, passed a nonbinding resolution in 1978, which stated: “It is the sense of the Congress that there should be prior consultation between the Congress and the executive branch” on any changes affecting the Mutual Defense Treaty. While Congress was out of session, President Carter officially recognized the PRC and unilaterally terminated the treaty.

Justices Harry Blackmun and Byron White would said the Court should have held oral argument and given the case full consideration.

Bush, in the aftermath of 9/11, asserted authority to terminate and suspend treaties as Commander in Chief and sole organ of American foreign policy. On December 13, 2001, President Bush announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Antiballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty that had been signed with the Soviet Union in 1972. Bush reasoned that the treaty undermined the ability of the United States to protect the nation from “terrorist or rogue state missile attacks.” Thirty-two members of the House of Representatives filed suit, arguing that since the Supremacy Clause classified treaties, like statutes, as the “supreme Law of the Land,” that the president may not terminate treaties without congressional consent. A federal district court held, in Kucinich v. Bush (2002), that the legislators lacked standing to bring the case, which also raised a nonjusticiable political question. The lawmakers did not appeal and thus the ABM Treaty was terminated.  On February 7, 2002, President Bush asserted an understanding of the Commander in Chief Clause, broad enough, in the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), to suspend the Geneva Convention’s prohibitions on torture. His assertion, and the notorious legal memos authored by attorneys in the Bush Administration—in the OLC, the Attorney General’s Office, and the White House Counsel—unleashed an international firestorm on the question of whether the president might authorize the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, in conflict with domestic and international law prohibitions against such conduct. It is likely that future presidents will also invoke the Commander in Chief Clause or the sole organ doctrine as authority to terminate or suspend treaties, as well.

But sole executive agreements have inspired concerns about the president’s authority, as debates surround legal rationales invoked by the administration. Presidents have assumed discretion to decide whether to pursue an international agreement as a treaty, a sole executive agreement, or in the form of a legislative-executive agreement. The president’s decision typically hinges on political factors, including the likelihood of securing Senate approval. Presidents often have chosen to exclude the Senate in making some controversial and historic international pacts through the channel of executive agreements, among them, the Destroyer-Bases deal with Great Britain in 1940, the Yalta and Potsdam agreements of 1945, the Vietnam peace agreement of 1973, and the Sinai agreements of 1975.

Supporters of the Brick Amendment, including leaders of the American Bar Association, found virtue in the proposal for several reasons. Some “resented” as Alexander DeConde, a historian of American diplomacy, explained, “executive agreements such as those made at Yalta,” and sought to curtail presidential unilateralism in foreign affairs. Others were fearful of the effect within the United States of such treaties as the UN Charter, the Genocide Convention, and the UN’s draft covenant on human rights. Still others supported it as a useful isolationist response to the internationalism of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman.   The Bricker Amendment, approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 1953, reaffirmed the Constitution’s supremacy over treaties; required implementing legislation “which would be valid in the absence of treaty” before a treaty could be effected within the United States; and granted Congress the authority to regulate all executive agreements.

After failing in his efforts to seek compromise with the Bricker forces, Eisenhower sought assistance from Senate Democrats. Senator Walter George (D-GA) introduced his own amendment, which reiterated the Constitution’s supremacy over treaties and executive agreements. In a key passage that reflected the widespread opposition to the expansive use of unilateral executive agreements, the George proposal would have required implementing legislation for executive agreements (but not for treaties) to take effect within the United States. The Eisenhower Administration lobbied intensively for the defeat of both the Bricker and George proposals, principally because the advisers believed it would strip the president of important prerogatives and transfer executive authority over foreign affairs from the executive to the legislative branch. The Bricker Amendment was defeated in the Senate in February 1954 by a vote of 50-42. But the George Amendment fared better; it fell just one vote short of the two-thirds required for approval.

The reception of an ambassador entails consequences under international law, chiefly the recognition of foreign governments and states. The Framers, operating against a backdrop of international law principles that held that sovereign nations have a duty to receive ambassadors from other sovereign nations, determined, as Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 69, to impose this duty on the president as a matter of “convenience.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_241","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_241","title":"Hamilton said that the authority “to receive ambassadors and other foreign ministers . . . is more a matter of dignity than authority.

In fact, Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution emphatically declares, “He shall, [not ‘may’] receive Ambassadors and other public ministers,” an injunction that stands in sharp contrast with the discretionary constitutional powers that the president may choose to exercise, such as the decision to “convene both Houses” of Congress. Thus, the Framers, as James Madison wrote in 1793, gave the president no prerogative whatever to reject foreign ministers. Madison explained that “when a foreign minister presents himself, two questions immediately arise: Are his credentials from the existing and acting government of his country?

Roosevelt decided to reverse the policy and recognize the Soviet Union. Roosevelt’s act of recognition then broadened into a unilateral agreement called the “Litvinov Assignment”—an agreement on property claims between the two nations. In United States v. Belmont (1937), Justice Sutherland upheld the validity of the pact and said the agreement derived its force from both the president’s status as the sole organ of American foreign policy and his power to recognize foreign governments. Justice Sutherland stated that Senate consultation was not required. The Court again considered the validity of the Litvinov Assignment five years later in United States v. Pink (1942). Once more, the Court upheld the agreement and enthusiastically embraced the “sole organ” doctrine. Thus in later years, President Harry S. Truman believed that he was firmly grounded in his decision not to recognize the People’s Republic of China as well as several of the communist satellite states of Eastern Europe. Under changing circumstances in later years, President Richard M. Nixon felt similarly authorized to reverse that policy in 1972 to extend what amounted to diplomatic recognition to the PRC, an effort that was completed in 1978 when President Jimmy Carter fully “normalized” relations with China through a unilateral decision to recognize the regime of Beijing and derecognize the competing government in Taiwan.

The exclusive nature of the recognition power, Kennedy observed, prevented Congress from passing a statute that undercut the decades-old position of the U.S. executive branch that resisted recognition of Jerusalem as part of Israel. Justice Kennedy noted the sensitive question of the status of Jerusalem in the Middle East and deferred to the expertise of the executive in engaging in “delicate” matters of diplomacy. Chief Justice John Roberts, in dissent, pointed out that for “our first 225 years, no President prevailed when contradicting a statute in the field of foreign affairs.” Chief Justice Roberts was essentially saying that the presidential role in receiving foreign ministers was, for the Framers, a “duty,” rather than a discretionary power.

The initial impulse for the policy that became the Monroe Doctrine was a British-inspired fear that France might have designs on Spanish colonies in the Americas. France explained that it harbored no intentions of laying hands on the colonies, but the concern motivated the Monroe Administration to contemplate policies to protect against European intrusion into the Western Hemisphere. Did the United States need to project itself into European politics, or could it entrust its sphere of influence to the geographic fact of the Atlantic Ocean?  On December 2, 1823, President Monroe declared in his celebrated message to Congress that the American continents were no longer open to European colonization and that the United States would regard any effort of the European powers to extend their government to any portion of the Western Hemisphere as a threat to its peace and safety. In the same breath, Monroe assured Europe that the United States would not interfere with its dependencies in the Americas or involve itself in matters purely European.

Subsequent administrations were not bound by doctrines proclaimed by their predecessors and, in any case, judged events in Latin America on the basis of U.S. interests, not by a principle that the United States should oppose every European action in the New World. In 1845, for example, President James K. Polk sought to affirm U.S. interests in Oregon on the basis of the Monroe Doctrine. But when, in 1848, Polk tried to invoke the Monroe Doctrine to defend the government of Yucatan, he was rebuffed by Sen. John Calhoun, a member of Monroe’s cabinet, who dismissed the doctrine as irrelevant to U.S. interests in Latin America. During the Civil War, Secretary of State Seward, calculating the interests of the United States, decided not to challenge French defiance of the Monroe Doctrine in Mexico.  It is worth noting that President Monroe, in his configuration of the doctrine that he proclaimed, did not believe that he might, unilaterally, order the use of military force to protect U.S. interests in the hemisphere. On the contrary, he disclaimed all pretense of executive authority to initiate military hostilities, without congressional authorization. In 1824, Colombia asked Monroe for protection against France. President Monroe, a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, well understood the commands of the War Clause of the Constitution, and stated in a letter to James Madison, then in retirement at Montpelier: “The Executive has no right to compromit the nation in any question of war”; and his Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams, replied to Colombia that “by the Constitution . . . the ultimate decision of this question belongs to the Legislative Department.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_179","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_179","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si30045","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si30070","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_180","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_180","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si30124","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si30149","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_477","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_477","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_463","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_463","title":"James K.

On March 12, 1947, in a message before a joint session of Congress, Truman declared: “At the present moment in world history, nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life.” Too often, he observed, that choice was not a free one. Thus, it would be the policy of the United States “to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” While Truman did not mention names of those free peoples facing subjugation, they included, most prominently, Greeks and Turks, their liberties endangered by communist influence and sources. Truman would ask Congress to provide them with $400 million in economic and military aid. The stakes were far higher than the freedom of the Greeks and Turks, Truman believed, for the United States was caught in a global struggle between two ways of life. Consequently, Truman deemed all of “the free peoples of the world” equally worthy of American assistance.

But Truman, unlike Monroe, believed that the executive did possess the power of war and peace, and he committed the U.S. to the Korean War, becoming the first American president to lay claim to unilateral authority to initiate war. The doctrine did establish guidelines for the remainder of the Cold War. It laid the groundwork for appeals to aid democratic forces, which left to subsequent administrations the determination of what constituted democratic behavior. Perhaps the most important legacy of the doctrine was that it inspired legislation that promoted its premises. For example, Congress established aid programs such as the Marshall Plan, and treaties, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), that committed the United States, economically and militarily, to the defense of Europe. The creation of the National Security Council and the dramatic increases in America’s military budget were also part of the Truman Doctrine’s legacy. For better or worse, many of the United States’ military actions, from Vietnam to its support of Afghani and Nicaraguan rebels, grew out of the doctrine.

In January of 1957, President Eisenhower pledged to defend the Middle East region “from any country controlled by international communism,” a platform that reflected the influence of President Truman’s commitment to supporting “free peoples” resisting foreign aggression. Like the Monroe and Truman doctrines, Eisenhower’s doctrine grew out of significant challenges confronting American interests. Since 1946, the United States had sought to counter Soviet encroachment in the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf.  The same impulse that energized the Truman and Eisenhower doctrines—Soviet aggression—provided the basis for what The New York Times in January of 1980, called the Carter Doctrine. In his State of the Union Address on January 23, 1980, President Jimmy Carter referred to the Soviet’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, and declared that “an attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.” The Carter doctrine hastened the buildup of American arms, a process that was already underway by January 1980, and for which some scholars gave him great credit. It was the Reagan Administration, however, that capitalized on the perceived need for greater military expenditures and reshaping America’s military.

Bush. Unlike his predecessors who, for the most part, were carving out doctrines that emerged from the United States’ entanglement in the Cold War, the Bush Doctrine grew out of the attack on America on September 11, 2001. More than presidents before him, who articulated the concept of preemptive war, President Bush counseled the need for America to engage in “preventive war.”  As articulated in a document entitled, “National Security Strategy,” released in September of 2002, President Bush warned against enemies seeking weapons of mass destruction, pledging to “act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed.” History, he said, “will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have entered, the only path to peace and security is the  path of action.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_264","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_264","title":"The United States had long accepted the idea of preemptive war, that is, a clear and demonstrable need to initiate military hostilities in the face of solid evidence of a forthcoming attack, as seen, for example, in the massing of an army on the nation’s borders. The concept if anticipatory self-defense is well-heeled, but the evidence to justify it must be compelling. But the Bush Doctrine surpassed the concept of preemptive war and suggested the unilateral authority of the president to strike against nations who might, someday, represent a grave threat to the United States. Senior members of the Bush Administration began to describe and defend it: The United States doesn’t need to wait for the mushroom clouds before acting in its defense.  The doctrine of preventive war had once been suggested to President Eisenhower, who dismissed it immediately as unacceptable and dangerous. Indeed, if other nations embraced the concept of preventive war, striking nations who they regarded as adversaries and feared future hostilities, the result would be war across the globe.
