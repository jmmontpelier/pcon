What we have come in subsequent times to understand as the Constitution’s “war powers” rests in a cluster of clauses spread over two articles, thus dividing the “war powers” between the executive and the legislative.  Article II, Sec. 2, provides that the president “shall be Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.” Article I, Sec. 8, vests in Congress the authority to “declare war,” and it is necessary to examine the Commander-in-Chief Clause in concert with that provision. The Framers, after all, created a system of integrated parts and powers. To what degree, if any, are war powers shared? To what degree may the executive and legislative branches act independently in the exercise of American military power? More specifically, does the Commander in Chief Clause empower the president to unilaterally initiate war or lesser military hostilities? In attempting answers to these and related questions, we will explore the debates in the Constitutional Convention, state ratifying conventions, the Federalist papers and other contemporaneous writings, Supreme Court decisions rendered at the dawn of the Republic, and early presidential interpretations of the Constitution. Let us explore the Framers’ blueprint for matters of war and peace, and how they envisioned the integration of the War Clause and the Commander in Chief Clause.

The Framers’ decision to withhold from the president the power to commence war signaled a dramatic departure from the existing models of government that placed the war power, indeed virtually all foreign affairs powers, in the hands of the executive. In The Second Treatise of Government (1690), John Locke had described three branches of government: legislative, executive, and federative. According to Locke, the federative power, or what we today refer to as the power to conduct foreign affairs, encompassed “the power of war and peace, leagues and alliances, and all the transactions withal persons and communities without the commonwealth.” The power, moreover, was “almost always united” with the executive. The separation of the executive and federative powers, Locke warned, would bring “disorder and ruin.” Similarly, Sir William Blackstone, in his distinguished Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765-1769), had explained that the king enjoyed absolute power over foreign affairs and war: the authority to send and receive ambassadors, make treaties and alliances, make war or peace, issue letters of marque and reprisal, command the military, raise and regulate fleets and armies, and represent the nation in its intercourse with foreign governments.

Congress was vested with the sole and exclusive authority to initiate war. The Constitution withheld from the president the sole power to make treaties, making him share that power with the Senate. James Madison and Alexander Hamilton referred to this combination as a “fourth branch” of government, which they expected would manage most of the country’s foreign policy responsibilities. The president was granted the authority to receive ambassadors, an act that entails important international legal obligations. But the founding trio of Madison, Hamilton, and Jefferson did not view the Reception or “Recognition” Clause as a font of discretionary executive power to decide whether the United States would have relations with other nations or to determine unilaterally the tone and temper of those relations. Rather, the Framers understood the recognition power as a narrow, clerk-like function or duty imposed as a matter of convenience on the president, rather than Congress, to carry out the nation’s obligation under international law to receive ambassadors from sovereign countries. The president was granted the authority to send ambassadors abroad but only after the Senate approved his nominations. He was not vested with the monarchical power to issue letters of marque and reprisal; that power was granted to Congress. Nor was he given the authority to raise and regulate fleets and armies. That power, too, was left with Congress. Finally, Congress was also granted plenary authority over foreign commerce.

An early draft reported by the Committee of Detail vested Congress with the power to “make war.” This bore sharp resemblance to the Articles of Confederation, which had placed the “sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war” in the Continental Congress. Charles Pinckney, who expected Congress to meet only once a year, objected to the plan because he thought the legislative proceedings “were too slow” to protect the security interests of the nation. The draft also proved unsatisfactory to James Madison and Elbridge Gerry. In a joint resolution, they moved to substitute “declare” for “make,” “leaving to the Executive the power to repel sudden attacks.” The meaning of the motion is unmistakable. Congress was granted the power to make—that is, to initiate—war; the president, for obvious reasons, would be empowered to act immediately to repel sudden attacks without authorization from Congress. ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_121","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_121","title":"There was no quarrel whatever with respect to the sudden attack provision, but there was some question as to whether the substitution of “declare” for “make” would effectuate the intention of Madison and Gerry. Roger Sherman of Connecticut thought the joint motion “stood very well,” saying, “The Executive shd. Be able to repel and not commence war.” George Mason of Virginia was against giving the power of war to the Executive, because he was not “to be trusted with it.” He was for “clogging rather than facilitating war.” The textual change was approved. Rufus King of Massachusetts furnished an explanation: “‘make’ war might be understood to ‘conduct’ it, which was an executive function,” a function reserved to the Commander-in-Chief.   The debates and the vote on the war power make it clear that Congress alone possesses the authority to initiate war. The war-making power was specifically withheld from the president; he was given only the authority to repel sudden attacks. James Wilson, who played a role only slightly less important than Madison’s in the Constitutional Convention, told the Pennsylvania ratifying convention: “This system will not hurry us into war; it is calculated to guard against it. It will not be in the power of a single man . . . to involve us in such distress; for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large.” Similar assurances were provided to other state ratifying conventions.

He “was for vesting the power in the President, who will have all the requisite qualities, and will not make war but when the Nation will support it.” This drew from Elbridge Gerry the rejoinder that he “never expected to hear in a republic a motion to empower the Executive alone.” Butler’s view received no second, which was not surprising, given the fact that several Framers in the course of discussion on June 1, had emphasized their opposition to a presidential war power. The very notion, it seemed, smacked of monarchism and the royal prerogative and, as a consequence, engendered fear and resentment. But give Butler credit for being a quick study. By the end of the August 17 debate on the War Clause, Butler clearly understood the Framers’ decision to place the war power under legislative control, as evidenced by his motion “to give the Legislature power of peace, as they were to have that of war.” The motion, which represented an about-face on Butler’s part, drew no discussion, and it failed by a vote of 10-0. In all likelihood, it was viewed by delegates as utterly superfluous given the understanding that the war power encompassed authority to decide on matters of war and peace. By the end of the Philadelphia Convention, then, there was no support among the delegates for a presidential power to initiate war.  Butler continued his effort to distance himself from his “one-hour” advocacy of an executive war-making power. At the South Carolina ratifying convention on January 16, 1788, Butler explained to his fellow delegates the nature of the Constitutional Convention’s debate on the war power. He said, “Some gentlemen were inclined to give this power to the President; but it was objected to, as throwing into his hands the influence of a monarch, having an opportunity of involving his country in a war whenever he wished to promote her destruction.” Butler failed to mention that he had been the only advocate of a presidential war power.

Second, the Founders, influenced by their own experience under King George III, whom they regarded as a tyrant, and by their understanding of history, lived in fear of a powerful executive, and were adamantly opposed to a president’s unilateral control of foreign policy. History had its claims. In Federalist No. 75, Hamilton stated: “The history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind, as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world, to the sole disposal of . . . a President.” In a letter to Jefferson in 1798, Madison observed:   “The constitution supposes, what the History of all Govts demonstrates, that the Ex. Is the branch of power most interested in war & most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the Legisl.”   The Framers’ decision to create a radically new blueprint for the conduct of foreign affairs justified Wilson’s remark that it was incorrect to consider “the Prerogatives of the British Monarch as a proper guide in defining the Executive powers.

The decision to commence war requires the most solemn, deliberative debate. It emphasizes the values of collective decision making. But the decision of how to conduct war, to determine strategy and tactics, pivots on a different value, that of efficiency. In Federalist No. 74, Hamilton adduced the basic reason for making the president Commander-in-Chief: the direction of war “most peculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of power by a single hand.” The power of directing a war and emphasizing the common strength “forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority.”  While the Framers rejected the Locke-Blackstone model for foreign affairs, they nevertheless drew their conception of the Commander in Chief Clause directly from English history. The office of Commander in Chief has never carried the power of war and peace. The title of Commander in Chief was introduced by King Charles I in 1639 in one of England’s wars with the Scots, and has always been used as a generic term referring to the highest officer in a particular chain of command. With the eruption of the English Civil Wars, both the King and Parliament appointed commanders in chief in various theaters of battle. The ranking Commander in Chief, purely a military post, was always under the command of a political superior, whether by appointed by the King, Parliament or, with the development of the cabinet system in the 18th century, by the secretary of war.

The appointment of General Thomas Gage as Commander in Chief from 1763 to 1776 caused the colonists grave concern, for he proceeded to interfere in civil affairs and acquired considerable influence over Indian relations, trade, and transportation. The bitter memory of his decision to quarter troops in civilians’ homes spawned the 3rd Amendment to the Constitution. These activities and others prompted the colonists in the Declaration of Independence to complain of King George III that he had “affected to render the Military Independent of and superior to the Civil Power.”   But the colonists had little reason to fear the governors who were given the title Commander in Chief (though they might resent them for ruling in London‘s interest), since the colonial assemblies claimed and asserted the right to vote funds for the militia as well as to call it into service. In fact, grievances came from the governors, who complained of the relative impotence of their positions. The colonists’ assemblies (and later, the states’) assertions of the power of the purse as a check on the Commander in Chief reflected an English practice that was instituted in the middle of the 17th century. By 1665, Parliament, as a means of maintaining political control of the military establishment, had inaugurated the policy of making annual appropriations lasting but one year.  This practice sharply emphasized the power of Parliament to determine the size of the army to be placed under the direction of the Commander in Chief.

The New Jersey Plan, introduced by William Paterson on June 15, did not conclude whether the executive should consist of a single person or several. But it did resolve that the executive was “to direct all military operations,” and that none of the persons composing the federal executive “shall on any occasion take command of any troops, so as personally to conduct any enterprise as General, or in other capacity.” The qualifying clause was meant to discourage a military takeover of the government. When Hamilton submitted a plan to the Convention on June 18, as taken down by Madison, he probably did not propose the title Commander in Chief, but he undoubtedly had it in mind when he said the president was “to have the direction of war when authorized or begun.” The words Commander in Chief were adopted by the Convention without debate and without explanation.

Early presidents often refused to initiate hostilities without prior authorization from Congress. In 1792 and 1793, President George Washington received urgent requests for the use of military force from governors who feared impending attacks by Native Americans. Washington stated that he had no authority to order an attack and deferred the issue to Congress, “who solely are vested with the powers of war.” Contrary to the charge that President John Adams acted unilaterally in the Quasi-War with France of 1798-1800, Congress, in fact, passed some 20 statutes to authorize the war. In Bas v. Tingy (1800), the Supreme Court held that those statutes had authorized imperfect, or limited, war. In Talbot v. Seeman (1801), a case that involved issues arising from the Quasi-War, Chief Justice John Marshall held that since the “whole powers of war” are “vested in Congress,” it is for that body alone to authorize perfect or imperfect war. In Little v. Barreme (1804), Marshall emphasized that the president, as Commander in Chief, is subject to statutory restriction. One of the statutes passed by Congress in the Quasi-War with France authorized the president to seize vessels that sailed to French ports. But President Adams ordered American ships to capture vessels which sailed to or from French ports, and, in his opinion for the Court, Marshall held that Adams’s order had violated the statute. Subsequent judicial rulings have reiterated that the Commander in Chief may be controlled by statute. Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion was especially significant since it trumpeted the very principle embedded in the appointment by the Continental Congress of George Washington as Commander in Chief of America’s military forces in the American Revolutionary War, to wit: the Commander in Chief is required to obey instructions and directions from Congress.

Unless the United States paid tribute, the pasha threatened to seize American ships and citizens. In response, Jefferson sent a small squadron to the Mediterranean to protect against the threatened attack. He then asked Congress for further guidance, since he was “unauthorized by the Constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense.” It was left to Congress to authorize “measures of offense.” Jefferson’s understanding of the War Clause underwent no revision. Like Jefferson, President James Madison was aggrieved by the punishment and harassment inflicted on United States vessels. In 1812, he expressed to Congress his extreme resentment of the British practices of seizing American ships and seamen and inducing Indian tribes to attack the United States. Madison complained, but said the question of “whether the United States shall remain passive under these progressive usurpations and these accumulating wrongs, or, opposing force, to force in defense of their national rights” is “a solemn question which the Constitution wisely confides to the legislative department of the Government.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_99","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_99","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si33573","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si33598","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_100","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_100","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si33652","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si33677","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_246","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_246","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_460","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_460","title":"Capture of the Philadelphia ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_247","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_247","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_318","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_318","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si52203","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si52235","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide16710","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Thomas Jefferson and the War Clause","thumbnail":"dr/Slide16710_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si16744","si16746","Text_Caption_139","Text_Caption_140","btn_previous_99","si33573","si33598","btn_next_100","si33652","si33677","Image_246","Text_Caption_460","Image_247","Button_318","si52203","si52235"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide16710"}}},{"id":"si16824","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_49","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_49","title":"Commander-in-Chief ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_35","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_35","title":"Madison, the Legislation, and the War Power ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_141","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_141","title":"The War of 1812 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_142","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_142","title":"Madison, the leading architect of the War Clause and, indeed, the Constitution, had led the way to vest in Congress, not the president, the authority to initiate hostilities. He remained throughout his career a paragon of consistency on the question of the constitutional repository of authority to commence war or lesser military hostilities. In 1793, Madison, in the context of a debate with Hamilton on issues arising out of the “Genet Controversy,” provided a powerful summation of the Framers’ design of the War Clause. “Every just view that can be taken of this subject,” he wrote, “admonishes the necessity if a rigid adherence to the simple, the received, and the fundamental doctrine of the constitution, that the power to declare war, including the power of judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature; that the executive  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_143","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_143","title":"has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war; that the right of convening and informing congress, whenever such a question seems to call for a decision, is all the right which the constitution has deemed requisite or proper.”   As president, in the War of 1812, Madison deferred to Congress on the question of using military force and declaring war against England. He asserted no unilateral powers and did not push the limits of his authority. His reaction to British outrages reflected what the Framers assumed a president would do in circumstances where the possibility of war would arise: refer the question of a response to the legislative branch. This strict adherence to constitutional forms by not handling the threat until it had reached our back yard, may have been one reason that the redcoats were able to march into Washington and burn the houses of government to the ground. On the other hand, the United States ultimately declared victory in the War of 1812. And so we must ask ourselves, what lessons about the war power can be learned from this experience?

Lincoln famously wrote, in a letter to his law partner in Springfield, Illinois: “Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel invasion, and you allow him to do so, whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose—and you allow him to make war at his pleasure.… This, our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing the oppression upon us.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_105","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_105","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si34047","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si34072","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide16964","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Mexican-American War","thumbnail":"dr/Slide16964_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si17049","Image_195","Text_Caption_148","Text_Caption_149","Text_Caption_150","btn_previous_105","si34047","si34072"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide16964"}}},{"id":"si17134","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si17136","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_52","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_52","title":"Commander-in-Chief ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_39","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_39","title":"The Civil War ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_151","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_151","title":"Lincoln as Commander in Chief ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_152","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_152","title":"President Abraham Lincoln’s actions in the Civil War have generated questions and controversies, but none of his assertions of power involved a claim to a unilateral power as Commander in Chief to initiate war. In the Prize Cases of 1863, the Supreme Court upheld Lincoln’s blockade against the rebellious Confederacy as a constitutional response to the sudden invasion of the Union, which began with the attack on Fort Sumter. During oral argument, the Lincoln Administration told the Court that Congress, not the president, is vested with the war power. The Court agreed. Justice Robert Grier stated that, as Commander in Chief, the president “has no power to initiate or declare war either against a foreign nation or a domestic state,” but in the event of an invasion, the president was not only authorized “but bound to resist force by force. He does not initiate the war, but is bound to accept the challenge without waiting for the special legislative authority.” The president, the Court reasoned, had no choice but to meet the crisis in the shape it presented itself “without waiting for Congress to baptize it with a name; and no name given to it by him or them could change the fact.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_107","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_107","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si34205","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si34230","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_108","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_108","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si34284","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si34309","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_252","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_252","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_463","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_463","title":"“Scott’s Great Snake” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_253","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_253","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_321","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_321","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si52524","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si52556","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide17100","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Civil War","thumbnail":"dr/Slide17100_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si17134","si17136","Text_Caption_151","Text_Caption_152","btn_previous_107","si34205","si34230","btn_next_108","si34284","si34309","Image_252","Text_Caption_463","Image_253","Button_321","si52524","si52556"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide17100"}}},{"id":"si17214","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si17216","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_53","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_53","title":"Commander-in-Chief ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_40","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_40","title":"Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_153","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_153","title":"On His Authority as Commander in Chief ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_154","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_154","title":"Apart from Lincoln’s early acts while Congress was in recess—suspension of habeas corpus, calling up the militia, raising an army and navy, and spending funds from the treasury, among them—which we have considered, there remains the need to review his Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, declaring as Commander in Chief, that all slaves in rebellious states “shall then, thence forward, and forever, be free.” In his final draft, Lincoln made no mention of any statutes; rather, he grounded his act on his authority as Commander in Chief. The proclamation, Lincoln declared was “sincerely to be an act of justice warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity.” Lincoln’s proclamation stood on a solid legal foundation. Under the International Law of War, every Commander in Chief in any theater of battle has the authority to seize enemy property, provided the seizure serves the ends of war. In Lincoln’s case, it was easy for him to determine that seizure of slave labor would undermine the ability of the Confederacy to wage war. The loss of labor, alone, inflicted a mighty blow on the southern economy, in addition to the availability of tens of thousands of former slaves who could not fight on behalf of the Union. Lincoln was circumspect in addressing the military “necessity” of the Emancipation Proclamation. Indeed, he had previously rejected similar proposals by his generals on grounds that their requests were premature. Second, Lincoln was mindful of the limitations of his authority as Commander in Chief to liberate southern slaves. He did not, for example, attempt to emancipate all slaves, for he did not possess such sweeping authority. His power was limited to freeing slaves in states that were engaged in rebellion against the United States.

Of the 1,198 passengers who died in that attack, 124 were American. The Lusitania carried war material, including rifle cartridges, shrapnel, and shell castings.

On February 3, Wilson addressed a joint session of Congress. He did not expect the German threat to be executed, but if it should be, he would come before Congress again “to ask that authority be given to me to use any means that may be necessary for the protection of our seamen and our people in the prosecution of their peaceful and legitimate errands on the high seas.” On February 28, Wilson returned to Congress. Two American vessels had been sunk. Since Congress was about to adjourn, he asked for authority to practice “armed neutrality.” Wilson declared: “No doubt I already possess that authority without special warrant of law, by the plain implication of my constitutional duties and power, but I prefer in the present circumstances, not to act upon general implication.

When he summoned Congress for a special session on April 2, Wilson confessed that his plan had been futile and asked for a declaration of war, saying, “Armed neutrality … is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents.” The recent loss of American merchant ships to German submarines, coupled with the disclosure of the “Zimmerman Note,” in which the German Foreign Affairs Minister proposed a German-Mexican alliance, with Mexico getting New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas, fueled the rising war fever. Upon Wilson’s request that Congress declare “the recent course of the German government to be, in fact, nothing less than war,” it declared war.  The arming of merchant vessels without incorporating them into the naval force was of dubious legality at international law. Moreover, an act of Congress of 1819 authorized any merchant vessel of American registry to defend itself against aggression or search by another merchant ship but not against a public armed vessel of a nation in amity with the United States. Further, no act of Congress authorized the president to assign gun crews to private vessels. It seems clear that Wilson’s action was illegal. Yet, to his credit, he never asserted on behalf of the Commander in Chief Clause an executive power to initiate military hostilities or to wage war without congressional authorization.

Our old destroyers cannot be sold as obsolete as is proved by fact.

On September 3, President Roosevelt announced an agreement to exchange 50 “over-age’ destroyers to Britain in return for the right to use British bases in the Caribbean and Newfoundland. The executive agreement was struck at a juncture in what could convincingly be seen as a genuine national emergency. The British stood alone against Hitler. The Nazi armies controlled France and were poised for an invasion of England. If Britain fell, Hitler’s conquest of western Europe would be complete and the danger to the United States grave. Of the 100 or so destroyers in English waters, about half had been destroyed or badly damaged when Churchill in May of 1940 asked the United States for a loan of 40 or 50 destroyers to help the Royal Navy hold the English Channel. A month later, as more destroyers were put out of commission, he renewed his request to Roosevelt: “Nothing is so important for us.… We must ask therefore as a matter of life and death to be reinforced with these destroyers.” The British King followed with a personal plea. Churchill, in July, had written: “Mr. President, with great respect I must tell you that in the long history of the world this is a thing to do NOW.” In August, “The worth of destroyer that you can spare to us is measured in rubies.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_117","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_117","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si34995","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si35020","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_118","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_118","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si35074","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si35099","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_717","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_717","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_718","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_718","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_711","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_711","title":"Wickes-class destroyers similar to those sent to England.

Before acting, he consulted with members of Congress and sought their consent. The question arose: Did the president possess the legal authority to conclude the destroyers-for-bases deal? Attorney General (and a future Supreme Court Justice) Robert H. Jackson advised Roosevelt the he did, indeed, possess the requisite authority to strike the agreement with England. Jackson invoked statutory authority. An act of 1883 authorized the president to sell naval vessels, and the act of 1940 authorized him to transfer, exchange, sell, or otherwise dispose of naval vessels and equipment if the chief of naval operations should certify that the equipment was not essential to the defense of the United States. When the naval chief certified that the destroyers might be spared, the essential criterion for the exchange had been satisfied. But Jackson also invoked the Commander in Chief Clause and the Supreme Court’s opinion in United States v. Curtiss-Wright (1936), for the proposition that the president enjoyed broad, though not unlimited, authority in the conduct of American foreign policy. The Curtiss-Wright case, discussed in detail in a subsequent section, has generated considerable controversy about the scope of presidential power in foreign affairs but, to Jackson’s credit, the opinion was cited as a supportive element of executive authority to conclude the agreement. Roosevelt and Jackson never asserted a presidential prerogative power to take action contrary to a statute.

While the destroyer exchange was permissible, he emphasized that an act of June 15, 1917, forbade sending out of the United States, vessels built under an agreement to deliver them to a belligerent nation, during a war in which the nation was neutral. This, Jackson said, would preclude delivery to Great Britain of the mosquito boats currently under construction for the United States Navy. Jackson also asserted that the president may accept the naval bases without a treaty if acceptance entailed no legal obligation on the part of the United States. Churchill’s insistence that the bases be considered as gifts, alleviated that legal concern. On September 3, 1940, President Roosevelt announced the exchange.   Roosevelt’s deal met with considerable criticism from contemporary legal experts. Some regarded his exchange of vessels for bases a violation of the United States’ neutral status and a violation of American and international law. Some critics contended that the president had usurped congressional power to define for the United States the requirements of international law respecting neutrality and an invasion of congressional power to declare war. In March 1941, Congress granted its blessing to the president’s action, when it provided retroactive ratification through the enactment of the Lend-Lease Act, which provided express authority for the president to transfer “defense articles” to other countries when he deemed this vital to the defense of the United States. As a consequence, foreign nations became beneficiaries of the act by virtue of their relation to the Axis Powers. In short, Lend-Lease amounted to a declaration of limited war.

The line was subsequently adjusted to include Iceland on July 7, 1941, when the president informed Congress that by agreement with the government of Iceland he had as Commander in Chief landed marines to supplement and eventually replace British forces there. In the same message he announced that he had instituted convoys to Iceland and all other “strategic outposts.” On September 11, he announced that he had ordered the Navy to attack Axis submarines on sight. On November 17, at President Roosevelt’s request, Congress authorized the arming of merchant vessels. On December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, which responded with general declarations of war on the same day. Roosevelt committed an act of war when he established a naval patrol for some hundreds of miles into the Atlantic to report the presence of German and, later, Italian vessels. The information was relayed to the British. This made the United States, to a limited extent, a cobelligerent of Great Britain.

The statute sought to curb presidential war making and to require the “collective judgment” of the president and Congress before the U.S. troops could be committed to hostilities. The resolution was passed within the immediate context of the white-hot debate surrounding American involvement in the Vietnam War, but it can also be set within the larger context of legislative efforts to recapture the war power, which had been usurped by presidents since Harry S. Truman’s unilateral entry into the Korean War.  President Richard M. Nixon vetoed the War Powers Resolution. In his veto message, he stated that it was unwise, impractical, and dangerous to legislate the procedure by which the president and Congress would share the war power. Moreover, he argued that the measure infringed on the president’s constitutional power as Commander in Chief. Nixon informed Congress the “only way in which the constitutional powers of a branch of the Government can be altered is by amending the Constitution—and any attempt to make such alterations by legislation alone is clearly without force.” But both houses of Congress summoned the requisite two-thirds majority to override the veto: the House by a narrow vote of 284 to135 and the Senate by the wider margin of 75 to 18. The resolution thus became law on November 7, 1973.

Under section 3 of the resolution, the president is required “in every possible instance” to consult with Congress before he introduces troops into “hostilities” or into “situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.” This provision obviously vests the president with discretion to determine, at a minimum, whether consultation is “possible” and, perhaps somewhat more generously, whether it is desirable. Apparently, it also permits the president to determine when, how, and even whom to consult. Debate has arisen about the very meaning of “consultation.” Presidents have tended to treat it as a synonym for notification, while Congress has viewed it as a joint deliberation on a pending issue or problem.

But the actual effect of the act was, ironically, to empower the president to take action that the Constitution says he may not otherwise take. The War Clause of the Constitution (Article I, Section 8) requires a majority vote of both houses of Congress to authorize the initiation of hostilities against a foreign nation. It follows, therefore, that no smaller contingent in Congress may lay claim to the war power. And section 3 of the resolution contains a greater, more fundamental, constitutional flaw. Since the provision empowers the president to introduce troops into combat without prior congressional authorization, it not only repudiates the resolution’s stated aim of ensuring the “collective judgment” of both branches but also grants the president more power than he derives from the Constitution. The delegation doctrine prohibits Congress from delegating, sharing or transferring its constitutional powers to the president. Thus, Congress may not delegate to the executive its lawmaking or appropriations powers; nor may it delegate its sole and exclusive authority to decide for war.   The grant of authority to the president to introduce troops into hostilities also contradicts section 8(d) of the resolution, which states that the resolution is not intended to alter the constitutional authority of the president or Congress or to grant any authority to the president that “he would not have had in the absence” of the statute. Any attempt to vest the war power in the president, properly undertaken, would require a constitutional amendment since it involves a fundamental transfer of power from the legislature to the executive.

The president may extend the 60-day period for an additional 30 days if he certifies that it is necessary to protect American forces and remove them from conflict.   Section 5 vests in Congress two mechanisms for controlling the involvement of U.S. forces in hostilities: Congress can decide to withhold authorization of presidential action during the 60-to-90 day period or it can pass a concurrent resolution at any time to order the president to remove forces involved in hostilities.

In the second instance, Congress itself started the clock in October 1983 with the passage of the Lebanon Resolution, which reflected its frustration with Ronald Reagan’s unwillingness to file a report under section 4(a)(1) after Marines he had sent to Lebanon became targets of hostile fire in August 1983. That measure permitted President Reagan to keep forces in Lebanon for a period of eighteen months, but he removed most of the troops in February 1984.      The resolution’s most immediate and powerful congressional mechanism to control war making—the passage of a concurrent resolution to order the removal of troops engaged in hostilities—was gutted by the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v.

In May 1975, Ford ordered Marines to recapture a U.S. merchant vessel, the SS Mayaguez, which had been seized by the Cambodian navy. Ford’s report was the first and, until one filed by President Barack Obama in 2011 regarding military activities in Libya, the only report that specifically cited section 4(a)(1). The time-limit issue was moot, however, because Ford’s report was filed after the military operation had been completed. Controversy surrounded those early tests of the War Powers Resolution. The Ford Administration contended that it had satisfied the consultation requirements because it had notified congressional leaders prior to the introduction of armed forces. Members of Congress argued that consultation requires solicitation of congressional opinion prior to a decision to commit U.S. forces and that the premise and promise of collective judgment had been violated.

The purpose of the military action, he said, “was to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime.” Unlike his recent predecessors in the Oval Office who had initiated military hostilities without seeking prior authorization from Congress, President Bush, to his credit did, in fact come to Congress—twice—for statutory authorization to commit U.S. troops to combat in Afghanistan. Congress granted authorization on September 18, 2001. The “Authorization to Use Military Force,” (AUMF) passed by the Senate 98-0 and the House 420-1, authorized the president to use “all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided” the 9/11 attacks.        Two days after the air strikes in Afghanistan, President Bush sent a letter to congressional leaders on the military actions. He said he authorized the actions “pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.” The legal basis for his action consisted only of what he considered to be constitutional grants while ignoring the AUMF, which had provided him with the specific statutory authority to use military action against those responsible for the 9/11 outrage. Bush referred to the AUMF, only for reporting purposes and, like presidents before him, as a source of “support,” not authority. He stated: “I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution and (AUMF)… I appreciate the continuing support of Congress…”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_136","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_136","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_193","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_193","title":"President George W.

President Obama’s assertions represented an about-face from the position he had articulated as a candidate for the presidency. In his presidential campaign in 2007, Senator Obama was asked by Charlie Savage, then a reporter for the Boston Globe (now a reporter for The New York Times), under what circumstances a president would possess the constitutional authority to order strategic bombing of suspected nuclear sites in Iran without first receiving authorization from Congress. Obama stated: “The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.” He added that the president, as Commander in Chief, “does have a duty to protect and defend the United States” against actual or imminent threats. History, he said, has demonstrated that military action “is most successful when it is authorized and supported by the Legislative branch. It is always preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military action.” As president, however, Obama may have betrayed his campaign statements when, in March 2011, he unilaterally ordered military actions against Libya, a nation that seemingly had neither attacked nor threatened the United States.

On March 21, Obama notified Congress that two days earlier, at 3 p.m. EST, U.S. forces, “at my direction” commenced military operations in Libya to assist the UN action. He stated that the strikes “will be limited in their nature, duration, and scope.” By reporting to Congress, he complied with Section 4 of the War Powers Resolution, which requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours when U.S. forces are introduced “into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.” President Obama’s estimate that military action would last “days, not weeks,” however, fell short of the mark, as hostilities continued for seven months. Originally, the mission was designed to protect civilians; it became a policy goal: “Qaddafi needs to go.” As days passed, President Obama increased American military resources, including the deployment of Predator drones against Qaddafi forces, and engaged in collaborative efforts with Libyan rebels, to depose President Qaddafi. President Obama’s legal justifications for his exercise in unilateral executive war making soon became the subject of considerable scrutiny.

The criterion for authorizing danger pay was that troops were “subject to the threat of physical harm or imminent danger because of civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism or wartime conditions.” President Obama’s extended efforts to circumvent the WPR and his assertion that hostilities did not exist, were exposed by his own orders—deployment of armed drones, bombings and missile strikes—and his administration’s decision to grant danger pay.

There are also two kinds of war, which American courts have called “perfect,” or general, and “imperfect,” or limited, wars. In 1782 the Federal Court of Appeals, the prize court established by the Continental Congress, explained the difference. It stated: “The writers upon the law of nations, speaking of different kinds of war, distinguish them into perfect and imperfect: A perfect war is that which destroys the national peace and tranquility, and lays the foundation of every act of hostility. The imperfect war is that which does not entirely destroy the public tranquility, but interrupts it only in some particulars, as in the case of reprisals.” At all events, the president has no constitutional authority to initiate war or lesser military hostilities, but that has not proven to be an impediment to executive war making. Indeed, presidential aggrandizement of the war power has become a common theme for the past 60 years.   It is baffling that scholars, commentators, and politicians have so often said of American history that a declaration of solemn war, fully invoking international law, has been issued on only five occasions. In fact, Congress has passed resolutions declaring general war, declarations pure and simple, on 11 occasions (see right). All of these resolutions authorized the president to use the army, navy, and the militia for the prosecution of war.

Paraguay had closed its waters to foreign ships of war, and a Paraguayan fort shelled the Water Witch, which returned fire. In his annual message to Congress on December 8, 1857, President James Buchanan announced his intention to demand redress and asked Congress to authorize him to use “other means in the event of a refusal.” By joint resolution of June 2, 1858, he was authorized to “adopt such measures and use such force as, in his judgment, may be necessary and advisable.” Several ships of war were sent out and the difficulties with Paraguay were adjusted by commissioners, without resorting to violence.

On April 25, Congress passed an act declaring that a state of war with Spain had existed since April 21.  On several occasions, Congress has authorized limited war, that is, action restricted as to objective or as to instrument. The Supreme Court has held that the exercise of authority to determine the size, scope, and direction of war, is part and parcel of the congressional war power, described by James Madison as authority to “commence, conclude and continue war.” These acts, harking back to the earliest days of the republic, reveal presidential deference to Congress.

They sold treaties of peace and preyed upon the shipping of all states with which they were at war. The larger European powers easily could have destroyed them, but they found it more profitable to pay the Barbary states and keep them in business, for they greatly reduced the competition of smaller powers, such as the Italian states. In 1783, Benjamin Franklin wrote that “it was said to be a maxim among English merchants that ‘if there were no Algiers, it would be worth England’s while to build one.’”        The Continental Congress ratified a treaty of peace with Morocco in 1787 and with Tunis in 1798. Relations with Morocco were relatively peaceful and friendly until 1802, when the emperor denounced the peace treaty and declared war. On November 4, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson informed Congress that a Moroccan cruiser had seized an American merchant vessel, but the United States frigate Philadelphia had then captured both. Jefferson asked Congress “to consider the provisional authorities which may be necessary to restrain the depredations of this power should they be continued.” On December 5, he informed Congress that the emperor of Morocco had disavowed the action of his cruiser, had agreed to amicable adjustment of all difficulties, and had confirmed the treaty of 1787.

In 1785, Algerian corsairs seized two American vessels and enslaved their crews; in 1793, they captured several American vessels. On December 16, 1793, President George Washington informed Congress of his efforts “for the ransom of our citizens and establishment of peace with Algiers.” But on March 3, 1794, he reported lack of progress in the negotiations with Algiers. On March 27, 1794, Congress passed an act reciting that “the depredations committed by the Algerine corsairs on the commerce of the United States render it necessary that a naval force be provided for its protection,” and the act authorized the construction of six frigates. A treaty of peace with Algiers was ratified by the Senate on March 2, 1796. On March 15, 1796, Washington informed Congress that peace had been made but suggested that Congress might not wish to discontinue all naval construction. Congress, on April 20, voted that three frigates should be completed.  Congressional authorization of hostilities against the Barbary states is illustrative of early governmental adherence to the provisions of the Constitution, but the limited war with France from 1798 to 1801 is perhaps more familiar to students as an exercise of the sweeping authority of Congress to impose statutory limits on the Commander in Chief in the conduct of war. The war, moreover, gave rise to a series of landmark Supreme Court decisions that reaffirmed the Framers’ design of the War Clause and remain good law. Yet, as we shall see, advocates of unilateral presidential power on matters of war and peace have curiously advanced the Quasi-War as precedent for an executive war-making authority despite the fact that President John Adams asserted no unilateral authority to initiate hostilities.

Congress suspended commercial trade with France, terminated the 1778 treaty of amity and commerce with France, established a Department of Navy and a Marine Corps, augmented the navy, provided for raising an army in the case of need, reinforced the defense of ports and harbors, and funded additional cannons, arms, and ammunition. It also passed an act that authorized the president to instruct commanders of United States naval vessels to seize as prize any armed vessel that had, or which might be found hovering around the U.S. coast, for the purpose of committing depredations on vessels belonging to U.S. citizens. Another act , pursuant to congressional authority to grant letters of marque and reprisals, authorized the president to grant commissions to owners of private armed ships to capture armed French vessels and to recapture American vessels. Another statute provided that if the president should find American seamen impressed on the ships of the enemies of France captured by the French were maltreated, he must cause “the most rigorous retaliation” to be inflicted on French prisoners.

Tingy (1800), Justice Samuel Chase noted: “Congress is empowered to declare a general war, or Congress may wage a limited war; limited in place, in objects, and in time. . . . Congress has authorized hostilities on the high seas by certain persons in certain cases. There is no authority given to commit hostilities on land.” In the second case, Talbot v. Seeman (1801), Chief Justice Marshall wrote for the Court: “The whole powers of war being, by the Constitution of the United States, vested in Congress, the acts of that body alone can be resorted to as our guides in this inquiry.” These critical decisions thus recognized that Congress enjoys the sole and exclusive authority to decide whether to initiate war, to determine the size, scope, and nature of the hostilities, and whether the war might be limited to land or sea.  In authorizing war, Congress may place limits on what the president—as Commander in Chief—may and may not do. An act passed by Congress on February 9, 1799, authorized the president to instruct commanders of ships to seize vessels sailing “to” French ports. President Adams exceeded the statute by issuing an order directing American ships to capture vessels sailing “to” or “from” French ports. Captain George Little followed Adams’ order by seizing a Danish ship sailing from a French port. He was sued for damages, and the case came to the Supreme Court.

It announced only a fact and informed citizens what was required of them under settled laws. Hamilton’s position was modest: the president could proclaim neutrality to keep the United States out of war until Congress has determined to move the country from a state of peace to a state of war.

War is in fact the true nurse of executive aggrandizement. In war a physical force is to be created; and it is the executive will, which is to direct it. In war, the public treasures are to be unlocked; and it is the executive hand which is to dispense them.

Smith (1806), involved one of the most significant cases illuminating the power of Congress to restrict presidential action. President Jefferson recognized the importance of enforcement of the Neutrality Act. There was, he believed, extreme danger in allowing private citizens to decide by themselves to deploy armed forces. In his fourth annual message he referred to complaints that people residing in the United States had used armed merchant vessels in defiance of the laws of the other countries: “That individuals should undertake to wage private war, independently of the authority of their country, can not be permitted in a well-ordered society.” The tendency, he said, was “to produce aggression on the laws and rights of other nations and to endanger the peace of our own.”  Numerous cases involving violation of the Neutrality Act came before the federal courts. In 1806, a circuit court reviewed the indictment of Colonel William S. Smith for engaging in military actions against Spain. He claimed that his military expertise “was begun, prepared, and set on foot with the knowledge and approbation of the executive department of our government.” The Court rejected his claim that a president or his assistants could somehow authorize military adventures that violated congressional policy. U.S. Supreme Court Justice, William Paterson, who had been a central figure as a New Jersey delegate to the Constitutional Convention, was riding circuit, and wrote for the Court that the Neutrality Act is “declaratory of the law of nations; and besides, every species of private and unauthorized hostilities is inconsistent with the principles of the social compact, and the very nature, scope, and end of civil government.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_175","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_175","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si39577","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si39602","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_176","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_176","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si39656","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si39681","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_743","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_743","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_730","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_730","title":"William Paterson.

Douglas contended that the president required authority to act swiftly in the face of emergencies. “With tanks, airplanes and the atom bomb, war can become instantaneous and disaster can occur while Congress is assembling and debating.” Though Congress had the power to declare general war, situations “calling for the retail use of force,” Douglas suggested, ought to be left to the to the president, as they had been left throughout American history. There might be “grave dangers” in thus giving the presidency discretionary power to commit troops to battle, but Douglas found consolation in “the sobering and terrible responsibilities of the Office of President itself” and in the fact that action grossly offensive to the national interest and public will could lead to impeachment.

In these circumstances I have ordered United States air and sea forces to give the [South] Korean Government cover and support.” In fact, Truman had already committed American forces prior to the UN call for assistance.

Nor is there any substance to the claim that the UN Security Council—or any international organization, for that matter—could authorize the United States to go to war, for at least two reasons. First, the U.S. Constitution vests the war power in both houses of Congress. Accordingly, the treaty power in the U.S.—the president and the Senate—cannot commit the nation to war without the approval of the House of Representatives. Moreover, mere membership in the UN, achieved through the treaty process, does not confer on the UN or the Security Council authority to require the United States to contribute forces to a UN action. The decision to commit forces to a UN mission must be conducted in accord with a member’s “constitutional processes,” leaving to a member state complete discretion to decide whether to participate in the mission. And, it should be noted, the UN is not a substitute for congressional representation of the American people. The decision for American participation in war cannot rest on the will of Lithuania or Italy. Surely, the question of going to war cannot depend on the shifting membership in that body.

As the war began to go badly, however, some conservative congressmen realized the implications of unilateral presidential war making for the United States and the Constitution. One of the critics, Rep. Frederic R. Coudert, Jr. (R-NY), observed, “how devastating the precedent they have set in remaining silent while the President took over the powers specifically reserved for Congress in the Constitution.” Truman’s aggrandizement of power, coupled with his intention that he would be sending four more divisions to reinforce the American army in Europe, led Coudert to introduce on January 3, 1951, a resolution declaring it the sense of Congress that ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_277","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_277","title":"“no additional military forces” could be sent abroad “without the prior authorization of the Congress in each instance.” The resolution also provided that no funds appropriated for the armed forces could be used for sending troops abroad. Clearly, Rep. Coudert meant to tie the hands of the president and restore congressional control over troop deployments and the use of military force.  President Truman told a press conference the next day that he did not require the approval of Congress to send more troops to Europe. A week later, he extended his claim of authority: “under the President’s constitutional powers as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces,” he possessed authority to send troops anywhere in the world, that this power had been “repeatedly recognized by Congress and the courts,” and that his administration would “continue to send troops whenever it is necessary to uphold” its obligations to the United Nations. When asked about constitutional precedents, he said, “I haven’t got it with me just now, but you will find decisions by at least three Chief Justices on that very subject.” Truman said that the opinion of the Court did not require him to consult with Congress, and added, “I do not have to unless I want to. But of course I am polite, and I usually always consult them. . . . The opinions are all in favor of the President’s exercise of the Presidential power when in his judgment it is necessary.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_195","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_195","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41157","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41182","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_196","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_196","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41236","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41261","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide22167","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Attempts to Limit Presidential Use of Military Force","thumbnail":"dr/Slide22167_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si22201","Text_Caption_275","Text_Caption_276","Text_Caption_277","btn_previous_195","si41157","si41182","btn_next_196","si41236","si41261"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide22167"}}},{"id":"si22288","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si22290","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_102","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_102","title":"Commander-in-Chief ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_94","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_94","title":"Battle is Joined ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_279","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_279","title":"The battle was joined. For the first time in American history, the presidency and Congress were engaged in a “Great Debate” about which branch possessed the authority to commit troops abroad. Senator Robert Taft (R-Ohio), the son of William Howard Taft, the only person ever to have served both as president and Supreme Court Justice (in his case, Chief Justice), rebuked Truman for his usurpation of the war power. The issue of troop deployment, whether to Korea, or to UN missions, or to Europe, was an issue to be debated and decided by Congress. Various senators— Paul Douglas, J.W. Fulbright, Herbert Lehman, and Wayne Morse, among others—challenged Taft. Fulbright declared that if the president thought the defense of America required the dispatch of troops to Europe, “he has the power and the duty to do so.” Senator Fulbright inserted in the Congressional Record the full text of the Supreme Court’s controversial opinion in United States v. Curtiss-Wright (1936), to vindicate the “discretionary power which I believe is inherent in the President of the United States in the field of foreign affairs.” Senator Tom Connally, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, stated: “The authority of the President as Commander in Chief to send the Armed Forces to any place required by the security interests of the United States has often been questioned, but never denied by authoritative opinion.” Secretary Acheson contended that the president’s power was not only inherent, but exclusive: “Not only has the President the authority to use the Armed Forces in carrying out the broad foreign policy of the United States and implementing treaties, but it is equally clear that this authority may not be interfered with by Congress in the exercise of powers which it has under the Constitution.” And then, in a fit of frustration, he dismissed the relevance of the law and the Constitution: “We are in a position in the world today where the argument as to who has the power to do this, that, or the other thing, is not exactly what is called for from America in this very critical hour.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_197","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_197","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41315","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41340","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_198","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_198","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41394","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41419","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_360","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_360","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_517","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_517","title":"Tom Connally ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_361","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_361","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_375","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_375","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si58302","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si58334","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide22254","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Battle is Joined","thumbnail":"dr/Slide22254_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si22288","si22290","Text_Caption_279","btn_previous_197","si41315","si41340","btn_next_198","si41394","si41419","Image_360","Text_Caption_517","Image_361","Button_375","si58302","si58334"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide22254"}}},{"id":"si22368","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si22370","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_103","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_103","title":"Commander-in-Chief ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_95","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_95","title":"Contemporary Arguments on the President’s Authority ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_281","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_281","title":"Distinguished scholars, many of them supportive of President Truman’s broad claims of authority, joined the argument.

Corwin for many years the dean of constitutional scholars, denounced the eminent historians, describing them as “high-flying prerogative men” who ascribed to the president “ a truly royal prerogative in the field of foreign relations . . . without indicating any correlative legal or constitutional control to which he is answerable.” Professor Corwin contended that the fact that Congress had not exercised its power to deploy troops did not mean that it lacked such authority. Rather, in the teaching of Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion in Little v. Barreme, the president was obligated to follow congressional instructions when Congress chose to intervene. Corwin supported the Coudert resolution and said that Congress could not be reduced to a rubber stamp of presidential policies. It is a mark of the open-mindedness of Professors Commager and Schlesinger that, upon closer scrutiny of legal and constitutional materials in the context of the Vietnam War, they recanted their positions on presidential and congressional power and urged acknowledgment and enforcement of congressional control of the war power.

The president, he was fond of saying, was the “Constitutional Leader.” “There are many, many who can recommend, advise, and sometimes a few of them consent,” he said in a speech in 1966. “But there is only one that has been chosen by the American people to decide.”  In the spring of 1965, President Johnson asserted his authority as Commander in Chief when he deployed  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_288","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_288","title":"22,000 American troops to the Dominican Republic.

Johnson’s real purpose, he disclosed was that “we don’t propose to sit here in our rocking chair with our hands folded and let the Communists set up any government in the Western Hemisphere.” Johnson never sought authorization from Congress; indeed, he contended that he did not need authority or support from Congress to promote the national security interests of the United States.  Johnson proceeded with the same level of confidence and conviction in deploying 500,000 troops to Vietnam, as he proclaimed the Indochina War to be “America’s War.” The war, of course, would last longer than any in American history and it would cause more American deaths in combat than any except the Civil War and the two world wars, and cost more money than any except the Second World War. His decision, a unilateral executive decision, was momentous. Where did he find precedent for his war?

The resolution purported to authorize Johnson’s war in Southeast Asia, although Johnson claimed that he never needed congressional authorization for his military actions. In August 1964, after President Johnson reported two attacks on U.S. vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin, Congress quickly passed legislation to authorize the use of force. There were doubts at the time of the second attack, but Congress did not take the time to verify Johnson’s claims. In 2005, the National Security Agency publicly acknowledged that the alleged second attack never occurred.   On August 3, 1964, President Johnson announced that he had ordered retaliatory actions against the North Vietnamese for their operations in the Gulf of Tonkin. He spoke following an attack on the U.S. Destroyer Maddox, by Communist PT boats. On the following day he reported a second attack, this one against two American destroyers off the coast of North Vietnam. Johnson called in congressional leaders. Reminding himself, and members of Congress, of Senator Taft’s criticism of President Truman for not seeking congressional ratification of the Korean decision, Johnson asked their judgment about drafting something that “would give us the opinion of Congress.” The leaders liked the idea and the administration pulled out a draft resolution, prepared weeks before and awaiting passage. A special message to Congress on August 5 requested a joint resolution to affirm the United States’ determination to respond to North Vietnam’s attacks. He explained: “As I have repeatedly made clear, the United States intends no rashness and no wider war.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_205","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_205","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41947","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si41972","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_206","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_206","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si42026","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si42051","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_756","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_756","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_746","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_746","title":"USS Franklin D.

Was this a declaration of presidential power to use force without congressional authorization? Was Congress trying to delegate the war power to the president?

Thus, the president might deploy troops and engage in military force to support any of these nations who thought their defense was threatened.   Plainly, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution represented an unconstitutional delegation of the war power. Congress, as we have seen, must decide on matters of war and peace. It is prohibited from transferring or delegating to the executive those constitutional powers— appropriations, law making and the war power—granted to it by the Constitution. Where the courts have held that Congress may delegate a “lesser power,” Congress is required to fix the standard and the policy to guide the exercise of the delegated power, but the resolution makes no attempt to supply a fixed standard to instruct or guide the president’s decision to use force, other than by his own will. As seen in our discussion of the War Powers Act of 1973, Congress is prohibited by the Constitution from transferring the war power to the president. Senator Nelson attempted to limit the authority granted by the resolution when he offered an amendment that President Johnson would seek “no extension of the present military conflict” and that “we should continue to attempt to avoid a direct military involvement in the southeast Asian conflict.” But Senator Fulbright refused to accept any amendments since, he believed, they would delay passage and would have to be settled in conference with the House.

When Senator John Sherman Cooper asked whether, “if the President decided that it was necessary to use such force as he could lead into war, will we give that authority by this resolution?” Fulbright replied, “That is the way I would interpret it.” He added, with an air of hope, “I have no doubt that the President will consult with Congress in case a major change in present policy becomes necessary.” The vagueness of the language and the motives behind it spurred uncertainty and doubt about the vote to support the resolution. Many senators who voted for the resolution did not believe that they were authorizing an extended land war in Southeast Asia. And defenders of President Johnson did not suppose that Johnson, himself, was interested in a large, protracted war in 1964 when the resolution was passed.   In the end, LBJ’s request for the “opinion of Congress,” was of little importance, given his expansive view of presidential power to wage war. “We stated then,” he said in 1967 of his meeting with congressional leaders when he first raised the idea of a resolution, “and we repeat now, we did not think the resolution was necessary to what we did and what we’re doing.” The importance of the resolution to Johnson was purely political. “Part of being ready, to me,” he wrote in his memoirs, “was having the advance support of Congress for anything that might prove to be necessary. It was better to have a firm congressional resolution, and not need it, than some day to need it and not have it.” Johnson never believed that the resolution provided the legal authority for his war in Vietnam.

The SEATO Treaty, like the United Nations Treaty, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, specifically states that member nations are to answer requests for troops in accordance with their “constitutional processes.” In the United States, the “constitutional process” calls for Congress, alone, to make decisions on matters of war and peace.

In any case, the Supreme Court has repeatedly denied claims that the president can acquire power by a series of usurpations. If it were otherwise, the president might aggrandize all governmental power. Neither Congress nor the judiciary could lawfully restrain the exercise of the president’s accumulated constitutional powers.

Further study and understanding of the procedural distinction in Congress between the authorization and appropriation processes persuaded some judges that funding was not the legal equivalent of endorsing a policy. In Atlee v. Laird (1972), federal appellate judge, Arlan Adams, reasoned that it would be impossible to decide whether legislators, in voting on appropriations, actually intended to authorize military hostilities in Vietnam: “to explore these issues would require the interrogation of members of Congress regarding what they intended by their votes, and then synthesization of the various answers.

The concept of “preemptive” war was founded in the right of a nation to use military force in self-defense, that is, in anticipation of an immediate attack, such as the massing of troops on the border, an armada gathering at the coast, or clear, firm, and solid intelligence that an adversary is about to initiate hostilities with little time to deter the strike. Secretary of State Daniel Webster explained the doctrine under international law after the British, in 1837, sank an American ship, the Caroline, in United States waters because it was being used to supply insurrectionists against British rule in Canada. Webster acknowledged that a nation could use military force in the territory of another state, but only in those “cases in which the necessity of that self-defense is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation.” Article 51 of the United Nations Charter permits the use of military force for self-defense, “if an armed attack occurs.” Presumably, the Charter embodies the right of a nation to strike preemptively; after all, why should a sovereign state be made to suffer military blows against its territorial integrity that it knows will be inflicted?

Aside from the matter of constitutional standards, it is worthwhile to consider the implications of the influence of the Bush doctrine of preventive war for international peace and stability. If other nations, say India and Pakistan, embraced that doctrine, the historic and, it should be said, ongoing tensions between those nations might tempt one or the other to launch preventive strikes in fear of future attacks by the other. The result would be chaos and, perhaps, nuclear war. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was once encouraged by an aide to embrace the concept of preventive war, but he immediately rejected the aide and his advice, warning that that doctrine was a recipe for disaster.

Attorney General John Ashcroft, testifying in hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, claimed that the President’s authority to establish military tribunals “arises out of his power as Commander-in-Chief. For centuries, Congress has recognized this authority, and the Supreme Court has never held that any Congress may limit it.” Ashcroft’s defense of President Bush’s purported unilateral authority to establish the commissions went beyond legal arguments and invoked themes of loyalty and patriotism. Ashcroft, in a prepared statement, told the committee that those who voiced opposition to the administration’s policies, gave aid and comfort to the terrorists: “Your tactics only aid terrorists, for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve. They give ammunition to America’s enemies and pause to America’s friends. They encourage people of good will to remain silent in the face of evil.” The Attorney General’s criticism of dissident speech was not the first time that an administration official has attempted to discourage opposition views by characterizing them as serving a foreign foe and giving aid and comfort to the enemy, but the approach demonstrates little regard for the 1st Amendment guarantee of free speech and the important role that dissent plays in a democracy.

The Geneva Convention of 1949, which consisted of four conventions, was ratified by the United States on July 14, 1955. These conventions, along with the two additional proposals of 1977 constitute Geneva Law—a detailed body of rules that govern the treatment of victims of armed conflict. The treaties were written and adopted against the backdrop of World War II, which revealed serious deficiencies in the law of war. Among other things, the Geneva Conventions sought to protect various categories of persons subject to the authority of the enemy. Toward the end, the conventions apply in all cases of armed conflict between two or more states, even if a state is not a party to the treaties. At a minimum, prisoners of war (POWs) and all persons no longer playing an active role in the hostilities are entitled to humane treatment. In short, Geneva Law governs the treatment of all detainees subject to the authority of the enemy. As a consequence, all detainees, whether classified as POWs, unlawful combatants or, those no longer participating in the hostilities, are protected by Geneva Law. The requirement of “humane treatment” for detainees imposes on the United States, as the detaining power, to provide protection “against all acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.” It also provides that “no physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever.” Al Qaeda terrorists are a complicated case,though, since they were illegal combatants not in uniform, and sometimes violating the laws of war themselves. The Bush Administration thus claimed to not be entirely clear how the Geneva protocols were to operate on them.

On February 7, 2002, President Bush issued a finding in which he declared his constitutional authority to suspend the Geneva Convention, and by implication the federal statutes in which the treaties are embodied. He accepted the legal conclusions of the OLC that no part of the Geneva Conventions applied to al Qaeda, and that parts of it would apply to Taliban detainees, though they were not entitled to full POW status. The president announced, nonetheless, that the United States would “treat detainees humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva.”        President Bush’s assertion of authority to cherry pick among the statutory and treaty provisions that he would choose to enforce, rendered him vulnerable to criticism from legal scholars, international lawyers, military leaders, and members of Congress, who denounced his suspension of the Geneva protections. It was true that Bush was ignoring the precedents of his predecessors who, since 1949, had never declined to apply the Geneva Conventions to those captured in armed conflict, including the Vietcong.

As reported in the Times, the NSA had been monitoring the international telephone calls and international emails “of hundreds, perhaps thousands” of people across the intervening years in an effort to obtain evidence about terrorist activity.      In a weekly radio address on December 18, 2005, President Bush said that he had authorized the NSA, “consistent with U.S. law and the Constitution, to intercept the international communications of people with known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations.” The warrantless surveillance program was named the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), after the NY Times story revealed its existence, in hopes of building congressional and public support for its legitimacy.

At a news conference, President Bush said that as president “and Commander in Chief, I have the constitutional responsibility and the constitutional authority to protect our country. Article II of the Constitution gives me that responsibility and the authority necessary to fulfill it.” In addition, Bush invoked a statutory source of authority—the Authorization of Use of Military Force (AUMF) that Congress had passed immediately after 9/11 to engage in military hostilities against al Qaeda. On the same day, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales held a press briefing on the TSP, asserting that “the President has the inherent authority under the Constitution, as Commander in Chief, to engage in this kind of activity.” Gonzales was asked why the administration would not seek warrants from the FISA court. He replied that the administration had been seeking warrants form the court but that it was not “legally required” to do that in every case if another statute, such as the AUMF, granted the president  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_355","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_355","title":"independent authority. The Bush Administration continued to cite both Article II and the AUMF, but as time passed it increasingly relied on the claim of inherent presidential authority. At bottom, the administration asserted that the president was not bound by the limits imposed by statutory law. Gonzales emphasized the need for “speed and agility” in the effort to intercept communications, and that FISA was passed in 1978, well before tremendous technological exchanges occurred. When asked why the administration had not sought to amend FISA, which had occurred several times over the years, Gonzales said that he had been advised that “that would be difficult, if not impossible.” Critics wondered if that was true, given congressional willingness in the past to make changes in the law.  In fact, the Bush Administration eventually retreated from its constitutional position and worked with Congress to alter FISA to permit the NSA to target persons “reasonably believed” to be outside the United States, after receiving authorization from the FISA court. Once the public learned of the existence of TSP, a heated debate exploded about the scope of presidential power to engage in surveillance. Americans, recalling the surveillance of the citizenry conducted by the Nixon Administration, voiced their concerns and sought renewed limits on the presidency. When the Democrats recaptured both houses of Congress in 2006 and demanded investigations of the administration’s surveillance practices, President Bush saw the handwriting on the wall, and conceded that Congress, indeed, may impose statutory restrictions on governmental surveillance.

Such intrusions are typically accepted by the White House in order to avert wartime defeat—rather than a gratuitous exercise of unilateral power. Lincoln didn’t suspend habeas corpus as an exercise in building a muscular presidency—he did it because he feared military consequences if he did not. To varying degrees, and for better or worse, this has been the logic thereafter at the White House about intrusions on liberty.

Congress passed some two dozen statutes authorizing Adams to take actions against France. Congress, dominated by the Federalist Party, was concerned about the pro-French factions in the country, as well as the influx of French and Irish immigrants, who harbored sympathies toward France and often joined the Jeffersonian Republicans. In addition, Congress drafted, with the support of President Adams, three significant bills to lengthen the time needed to become a citizen, to deport aliens, and to punish individuals who spoke or wrote what the government interpreted to be seditious statements. Adams had asked Congress to act with unanimity, which made it clear that the opposition party would be cast as disloyal.

He observed that fundamental differences between the English and American political systems rendered the limited English conception of free speech inappropriate for the United States.  In England, he noted, the rulers—kings and lords—were deemed the “superiors” of the people. In such a system, it was natural to require subjects to treat their rulers with respect and to prohibit them from criticizing their judgments and policies. In the United States, however, “a greater freedom” of criticism is essential, because governmental officials are “responsible to their constituents,” who have a right to bring them “into contempt or disrepute” if they fail “to live up to their trusts.”  Whatever might have been the case in England, Madison concluded, the Sedition Act violated the 1st Amendment because it undermined “the responsibility of public servants and public measures to the people” and embraced the “exploded doctrine” that the “administrators of the Government are the Masters and not the servants, of the people.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_261","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_261","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si46371","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si46396","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_262","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_262","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si46450","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si46475","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_782","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_782","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_783","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_783","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_769","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_769","title":"James Madison.

While serving his sentence, Congressman Lyon sought -–and won—reelection to the House, thus serving two terms at once. Lyon was the first candidate in American history to seek a seat in Congress while behind bars. The Federalists weren’t quite finished with Lyon. They tried to expel him but couldn’t muster the necessary two-thirds majority. Lyon and others prosecuted and convicted under the Sedition Act were pardoned by President Jefferson. In 1840, a repentant Congress determined that the act was “unconstitutional, null and void,” and appropriated funds to reimburse the heirs of those who had been fined under the statute. In 1964, in New York Times v. Sullivan, the U.S. Supreme Court noted that the Sedition Act had been rejected, not by a court of law, but by the “court of history.” President Adams was repudiated by American voters in the election of 1800, partly for his promotion and enforcement of the Sedition Act.

Lincoln’s suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus lay in the intersection of those two critically important, yet conflicting, goals.  The “Great Writ” was understood by the Framers as essential to liberty. A Writ of Habeas Corpus is a judicial mandate directing a government official to present to the court a person held in custody so that the court, and not the executive detaining the individual, can determine whether the detention is lawful. Without the writ, a president might order the detention of a person, indefinitely and without reason, and courts would lack authority to intervene. That person and, it may be said, justice, would be at the mercy of the executive. The Constitution carves out protection for the writ, but contemplates its suspension—in rare, indeed, extraordinary circumstances.

Such was the precious nature of the Great Writ—the safeguard of all liberties—that it stood like a mighty oak withstanding the winds of war. But the crisis that engulfed the nation during the Civil War, led Lincoln to suspend the Writ of Habeas Corpus on eight separate occasions. Most of the suspensions, including the initial one along the rail lines, applied locally, and responded to military situations that seemed urgent. From the outset, Lincoln delegated decisions to suspend the writ to local commanders. Some were responsible; others were not. During the war, military officers arrested some 12,000 civilians on a variety of charges and usually released them within a few days after they took an oath to support the Union. In too many cases, however, Lincoln was unable to control the execution of his own orders and, as a consequence, he found himself defending actions that he would never have approved of in advance. At all events, his suspensions of the writ triggered a great national—and historical—debate about the constitutional repository of the authority to suspend the writ.

On the eve of his inauguration, Lincoln had to travel through Baltimore, which was suffused with confederate sympathizers.

Since there was little historical precedent for the suspension of habeas corpus Lincoln, ever solicitous of constitutional concerns, turned to his Attorney General, Edward Bates, for guidance. Bates delegated the assignment to an assistant, who produced rather an inconclusive memorandum, but his research leaned on early authorities including Joseph Story’s magisterial three-volume treatise, Commentaries on the Constitution, which assumed that Congress enjoyed the exclusive authority to suspend the writ. Manifestly, the report was not encouraging and, with Congress still in recess, Lincoln decided to act unilaterally. On April 27, 1861, he issued an executive order suspending the writ in those areas of Maryland in which secessionists might interfere with military access to the nation’s capital.

To Taney, there was no real question of whether Congress or the president possesses the suspending authority. He “supposed it to be one of those points of constitutional law upon which there was no difference of opinion.” Taney found support in Chief Justice John Marshall’s opinion in Ex parte Bollman, Justice Story’s Commentaries on the Constitution, and President Jefferson’s application to Congress for authority to suspend the Writ of Habeas Corpus when he found it necessary to deal with the Aaron Burr conspiracy. Most compelling, however, was the location of the Suspension Clause in Article I, the constitutional provision that articulates congressional powers.

Still, if any president could have mounted a serious argument for an executive power of suspension, under the extraordinary conditions that confronted the nation, it was Lincoln. Given the grave challenges that faced Lincoln in Maryland, it was arguable that the ordinary justice system was overwhelmed and that some greater force had to be executed. Union troops were blocked by mobs in Baltimore. Local officials and courts were unable or unwilling to resolve the situation. Confederate armies were not far from Washington. The nation’s capital was in imminent danger. To think, as Lincoln reasoned, that the nation would have to await the return of Congress from its recess to suspend the Writ of Habeas Corpus, might sink the fortunes of the Union. What was Lincoln to do? In such dire circumstances, may the president violate the Constitution? Lincoln’s initial response was to assert a dual authority to suspend the writ, a shared power—between the Congress and the president. While Lincoln’s argument possessed some appeal, it was not persuasive enough. After all, a concession to his position that the executive might suspend habeas corpus, would ignore the fundamental rationale for creating the writ in the first place: to grant to the court the right to review and determine whether an exercise of executive detention is lawful. History and the preservation of the Constitution worked against President Lincoln. The English had struggled for many years to shift the power to suspend habeas corpus to Parliament. Moreover, the Framers’ deep-seated fear of executive power precluded any possibility of vesting in the president the final, exclusive word on the scope of his authority to suspend the “Great Writ,” and thereby deprive citizens of their liberty without legal process. ꌀꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣꎣ   Taney was undoubtedly correct in his ruling that Congress has the sole constitutional authority to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, as Marshall and Story had indicated. Still, if any President could have mounted a serious argument for an executive power of suspension, under the extraordinary conditions that confronted the nation, it was Lincoln.

His address remains one of the greatest moments in American constitutional history, where a sitting president concedes that he has violated the Constitution, but seeks its preservation in his words and deeds in asking Congress to ratify his illegal acts. Lincoln first acknowledged that some of his actions in combating the Confederacy—calling up an army and navy, spending money from the treasury, among other acts—had exceeded his authority, but that “his actions were not beyond the constitutional competency of Congress.” He said that his actions were carried out “under what appeared to be a popular demand and a public necessity, trusting then, as now that Congress would ratify them.” Lincoln was invoking the doctrine of retroactive ratification, the Framers’ solution to emergency. The virtue of the doctrine is that it maintains a semblance of constitutional government. Congress did “ratify” Lincoln’s actions after a lengthy debate, on the explicit assumption that his acts were illegal. When Congress granted the retroactive authority, it did so by passing legislation “approving, legalizing , and making valid all the acts, proclamations, and orders of the President, etc., as if they had been issued and done under the authority and direction of Congress.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_279","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_279","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si47793","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si47818","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_280","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_280","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si47872","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si47897","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_696","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_696","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_697","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_697","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_690","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_690","title":"A “sheepish” President Lincoln.

Lincoln said that “some consideration was given to the questions of power, and propriety, before this matter was acted upon.” Then he asked, rhetorically, “are all the laws but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?” But he quickly retreated from his theoretical exploration, saying, “But it was not believed that this question was presented. It was not believed that any law was violated.” The Constitution, Lincoln asserted, “is silent as to which [branch], or who, is to exercise the powers” of suspension, “and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be believed the Framers . . . intended, that in every case, the danger should run its course, until Congress could be called together.” In a more elaborate opinion, Attorney General Edward Bates rejected Taney’s holding that Lincoln had violated his constitutional duty to “faithfully” execute the laws. The executive, he said, was not subordinate to the judiciary, but was one of three coordinate departments of government. The president’s oath to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution” made it particularly his duty to put down the rebellion since the courts were too weak to do so. Thus, if the president, in the case of rebellion or insurrection considers the suspension of habeas corpus necessary for the public safety, he may order it on his own authority.

The statute did not greatly alter the internal security practices already in operation. Commissions appointed by the Secretary of War had been reviewing cases of civilians detained on suspicion of disloyal actions and releasing those against whom there was insufficient evidence for civil or military prosecution, and who expressed allegiance to the Union. But controversy arose when the Habeas Corpus Act Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt ruled that the statute did not apply to prisoners triable by military commissions.

Since portions of all the border states were at various times during the war occupied by Confederate troops or hostile guerrillas, martial law was employed there as an essential means of military security. Moreover, disloyalty to the Union in those areas was so widespread and so violent that the president considered martial law necessary for the preservation of peace and order. Typically, martial law was applied in specific limited districts where the situation seemed most serious, but in July 1864, President Lincoln placed the entire state of Kentucky under martial law. At the time of General Robert E. Lee’s invasion of Pennsylvania in 1863, Lincoln, in response to the petitions of many citizens, had put that area under martial law. In all of these instances, however, there was little interference with the civil authorities, and the power over citizens entrusted to military authorities was sparingly used. At bottom, the federal government made no effort to carry martial law beyond certain specified areas considered necessary for the successful prosecution of the war.

The controversy erupted in 1863-1864, particularly in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, where many Democrats who were strongly opposed to the president’s war policies that they demanded a negotiated peace and engaged in efforts to obstruct the prosecution of the war.   The most famous wartime military tribunal case involved Clement L. Vallandigham, one of the national leaders of the Copperheads and a former Democratic Congressman from Ohio who, in 1863, was placed under military arrest, and was tried and convicted for a public speech bitterly denouncing the Lincoln Administration. The five-member military tribunal found Vallandigham guilty of disloyal sentiments with the object of weakening the government. Before a huge throng of some 15,000 to 20,000 people, Vallandigham had declared the war, “wicked, cruel and unnecessary, asserted the right under the First Amendment to criticize the government,” and urged citizens to use the “ballot box” to “hurl King Lincoln from his throne.” His speech drew rousing cheers from the crowd. There is little doubt that Vallandigham’s speech, like Congressman Matthew Lyon’s speech criticizing the Adams Administration during the Quasi-War, would have been punished under the 1798 Sedition Act, as was Lyon’s. But that statute had been repealed and those punished—including Lyon—had been pardoned by President Jefferson. America, moreover, had long since rejected the English doctrine of seditious libel.

John Hay, Lincoln’s secretary, said that if the president had been consulted before any proceedings were initiated, he “would not have permitted them.” Lincoln’s security policy sought draft dodgers, deserters and bridge burners, not leaders of the Democratic Party, and no speakers such as Vallandigham. Lincoln’s own view of free speech, libertarian in scope, was that Vallandigham was protected in his right to criticize Lincoln and his policies. As Lincoln understood the arrest, Vallandigham could be punished, not for the expression of his views, but for his relative success in helping to persuade men to desert.  Vallandigham appealed his conviction, first to federal court and then the U.S. Supreme Court, with no success. The federal judge dismissed Vallandigham’s petition, which asserted that he had been denied his constitutional right to due process of law. The court reasoned that the president “is invested with very high powers” and “is amendable for an abuse of his authority by impeachment.” He fared no better before the High Tribunal with the argument that the jurisdiction of a military commission did not extend to a citizen who was not a member of the military forces. In Ex parte Vallandigham (1864), the Supreme Court refused to review the case, declaring that its authority, derived from the Constitution and the Judiciary Act of 1789, did not extend to the proceedings of a military commission because the tribunal was not a court. The Supreme Court, wrote Justice James Wayne in the official opinion, “cannot without disregarding its frequent decisions and interpretation of the Constitution in respect to its judicial power, originate a writ of certiorari to review or pronounce any opinion upon the proceeding of a military commission.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_287","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_287","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si48425","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si48450","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_288","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_288","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si48504","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si48529","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_795","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_795","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_796","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_796","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_779","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_779","title":"James Wayne.

With this case, the Court also laid down fundamental boundaries on the scope of martial law. In October 1864, Lambdin P. Milligan, a citizen of Indiana, was arrested by federal troops, tried by a military commission and sentenced to be hanged. Milligan was a Peace Democrat who believed the South should be allowed to leave the Union in peace. He had become a leader in an organization that planned to raid prisons in the Midwest and release Confederate prisoners of war. Although President Lincoln had suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the area, Milligan’s attorneys filed a petition seeking the writ with the nearest federal court. The court’s two judges disagreed on the merits and certified the case to the Supreme Court. In Ex parte Milligan, the Court finally, after hostilities had ended considered the question of the constitutionality of Lincoln’s use of military tribunals to try civilians. The Court held that the government could not constitutionally use military tribunals to try civilians, even in times of war or insurrection, if the civil courts were open and functioning, as they were in Indiana. To justify the use of military commissions, Justice David Davis, speaking for a 5-4 majority, reasoned that “necessity must be actual and present: the invasion real, such as effectually closes the courts and deposes the civil administration.” The case involved “the very framework of the government and the fundamental principles of American liberty.” The Constitution, Davis said, “is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances.” In a closing, trumpet call for an enduring Constitution, Davis wrote: “no doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_289","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_289","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si48583","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si48608","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_290","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_290","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si48662","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si48687","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_462","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_462","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_568","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_568","title":"Lambdin P.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Congress made it a crime for Japanese Americans to enter or remain in military zones designated by the president. Under this authority, the commanding general of the West Coast region ordered all such persons to obey curfews and to report to relocation centers for internment. The curfew order was upheld unanimously in Hirabayashi v. United States (1943) as necessary to prevent espionage and sabotage in an area threatened by military attack. No question of martial law or military tribunals was involved. When the Court finally reached the question of forced evacuation and relocation camps in Korematsu v.

At the same time, the Court in Ex parte Endo (1944), made some amends by approving the release on habeas corpus of a Japanese American of established loyalty from a relocation camp.  Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the governor of Hawaii suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus and placed the territory under martial law. After much delay, the Court held in Duncan v. Kahanomoku (1946), that the establishment of military tribunals to try civilians had been illegal. Although the military operations in Hawaii were very similar to those in Indiana during the Civil War, the Duncan opinion did not rely heavily on Milligan, and Justice Murphy stood by the rigid rule of that case that military trials are unconstitutional except in an actual field of military operations.       German saboteurs who landed on the east coast of the United States in 1942 with intent to destroy defense facilities were denied access to the civil courts on capture and were tried by military commissions on presidential order. Their defense was based on Milligan, but the precedent was rejected by the Supreme Court in Ex parte Quirin (1942).

Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. Whether the curfew and the forced evacuation policies could have been authorized by the order, alone, resting on the president’s power as Commander in Chief, was effectively a moot question, given that the Roosevelt Administration was successful in persuading Congress to pass a statute implementing the orders. Francis Biddle, Attorney General under FDR, observed that the president was not “much concerned with the gravity or implications of this step. He was never theoretical about things. What must be done to defend the country must be done.” Biddle said of Roosevelt: “Nor do I think that the constitutional difficulty plagues him—the Constitution has never greatly bothered any wartime President. That was a question of law, which ultimately the Supreme Court must decide. And meanwhile—probably a long meanwhile—we must get on with the war.” Biddle argued strenuously against the orders, but he was overmatched by the Department of Defense and other voices within the administration. In 1962, he wrote that internment had “subjected Americans to the shame of being classed as enemies of their native country without any evidence indicating disloyalty.”   The incarceration of Japanese Americans citizens during the Second World War was one of the most flagrant violations of civil rights ever inflicted by the United States government. All three branches of government—executive, legislative, and judicial—lost their constitutional compass. In its attribution to the president and Congress of sweeping “war powers,” broad enough to swallow up the citizenry’s rights to due process of law, government officials were blatant in their disregard of cherished American liberties and indifferent to the rule of law.
