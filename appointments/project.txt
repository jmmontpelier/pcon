In England, the King not only appointed officers, but also created offices. He also possessed the power of removal. The Framers were wary of such a concentration of power in the executive, and the many opportunities for mischief and abuse.   The Virginia Plan, submitted to the Convention by Gov. Edmund Randolph, proposed a “national executive” with authority to “appoint to offices in cases not otherwise provided for.” John Rutledge feared that vesting such authority in a single person would be “leaning too much toward Monarchy.”   James Madison, whose leadership in the Convention was unrivaled, shared the delegates’ concerns about locating too much power in the executive.

Madison’s supple mind prompted a compromise on the appointment power. He suggested that the Senate, with fewer members of the House, should be given the authority to appoint judges. The Convention tentatively accepted his plan into mid-June of 1787. Various delegates expressed concerns that the executive, armed with the power to appoint, might favor one region of the country over another. This concern reflected the Framers’ knowledge of the way in which English Kings had wielded the appointment power to curry favor, advance friends and allies, and promote different regions—all different forms of corruption. Thus Luther Martin recommended that the Senate would be “best informed of characters & most capable of making a fit choice.” Madison found this suggestion persuasive and offered yet another proposal: allow the executive to appoint judges with the concurrence of some fraction of the Senate. The virtue of this idea, he believed, was that it joined the responsibility of the executive with the security afforded by Senate opposition to “incautious or corrupt” nominations. Clearly, Madison was moving forward with the idea of granting the Senate the power of “advice and consent” on presidential nominees.

On September 5, the committee made its recommendations, which included what became the language governing the Appointment Clause in Article II of the Constitution. The committee’s decision was undoubtedly influenced by several factors, which formed a valuable road map for their consideration. As early as June 18, Alexander Hamilton, in his lengthy speech to the Convention, had proposed that the “supreme executive” ought to have the “power of appointment of the heads or chief officers of the departments of Finance, War and Foreign Affairs” as well as the authority to appoint “all other officers” and “Ambassadors to foreign Nations.”  The Senate, he said, should have “the power of approving or rejecting all appointments,” except department heads.   Hamilton’s own plan for the location of the appointment power was borrowed from the constitution of his home state of New York, which empowered the Governor to make appointments “with the advice and consent” of the executive council. In Massachusetts, whose constitution provided the best model for the office of president, the governor exercised his extensive appointment powers “by and with the advice and consent of the council.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_187","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_187","title":"June 18 of the Federal Convention ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_140","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_140","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_141","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_141","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_69","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_69","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18755","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18781","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_previous_86","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_86","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20886","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20911","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_87","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_87","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20965","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20990","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide15937","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Debates in the Convention on the Appointment Power","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15937_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si15971","si15973","Text_Caption_120","Text_Caption_121","Text_Caption_187","Image_140","Image_141","Button_69","si18755","si18781","btn_previous_86","si20886","si20911","btn_next_87","si20965","si20990"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15937"}}},{"id":"si24280","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si24282","class":"TODO::Senthil","title":" ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"si24297","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_66","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_66","title":"Presidential Appointments ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_214","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_214","title":"Presidential Appointments ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_127","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_127","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24208","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24221","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_128","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_128","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24253","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24266","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Web_7","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Web_7","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide24279","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Presidential Appointments","thumbnail":"dr/Slide24279_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si24280","si24297","Text_Caption_214","btn_previous_127","si24208","si24221","btn_next_128","si24253","si24266"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide24279"}}},{"id":"si16051","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_137","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_137","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_39","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_39","title":"Presidential Appointments ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_26","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_26","title":"The Appointment Power in the U.S. Constitution ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_122","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_122","title":"A Dance with Congress ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_123","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_123","title":"Explore the various aspects of the president’s appointment power by clicking on each box, right.

They were keenly aware of the increasingly important role that Parliament came to play in the 17th century, an influence that was secured through its capacity to advise and consent on legislation. The Framers’ decision to include the Senate in the Appointment Clause, signified an important limitation on the president’s role and authority. As with presidential proposal of treaties, a presidential nomination, exercised wholly within his exclusive authority to nominate, at least in a formal manner, would be meaningless unless it won the support of the Senate. If the Senate’s role in treaty making was legislative in character, its role in the appointment power was characteristic of a council. The Senate’s role in making treaties required its involvement in foreign policy decisions and negotiations. The Senate’s advisory power was more pronounced in the making of treaties than its role in the appointment process.   In the case of appointments, the president is given the initiative to make nominations, a constitutional ignition key not granted to the president in treaty making. But the Senate’s advice, with respect to appointments, loses some of its legislative character. The Senate does not share a deliberative and policymaking power with the president with respect to nominations, so much as it exercises the advisory capacity of an executive council.

The drafters were careful to create an independent executive function, as when they provided in the Appointment Clause, that the president “shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors.” If the Framers had wished to confer upon the president an exclusive authority to negotiate treaties, they easily could have provided that “he shall negotiate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, make treaties.” The carefully phrased section vests in the president an absolute right to nominate ambassadors, and the Senate can only offer its advice and consent to the appointment of a nominee. The Senate has no constitutional authority to interfere with the president’s power to nominate. But the language of the Treaty Clause is wholly different. In that provision, the words, “by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,” follow the words, “shall have power.” Thus, the “advice and consent” phrase is inextricably linked to the “power” conferred on the president, which is to “make treaties,” and it applies throughout the entire process of treaty making. In matters of treaty making, the Senate’s role in granting advice and consent in more expansive than it is with respect to appointments. The formal nature and language of the two-pronged phase—advice and consent—really limits the Senate to granting its consent to presidential nominations. As it happened, however, that formal textual distinction soon gave way to various policy and political concerns, not to mention partisan pressures in the First Congress.

There, Hamilton discussed the roles of the president in making nominations and the Senate in confirming or rejecting those nominations. Hamilton extolled the virtues of the formal division of labor: “Every advantage to be expected from such an arrangement would in substance be derived from the power of nomination, which is proposed to be conferred upon [the President] … In the act of nomination, his judgment alone would be exercised … ”  He added: “There will, of course, be no exertion of choice on the part of the Senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, and oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves choose—they can only ratify or reject the choice of the President.”   Hamilton was clearly representing the matured conclusions of the Constitutional Convention. Chief Justice John Marshall, in the seminal case of Marbury v. Madison (1803), affirmed Hamilton’s teaching and called the nomination process the “sole act of the President” and “completely voluntary.” While it is true, of course, that only the president can nominate ambassadors, judges and officers, making the power to nominate a plenary presidential power, presidents from the time of George Washington sought the advice of senators on nominations. It bears reminder that the mere act of executive solicitation of advice does not constitute a violation of the Constitution or a surrender of the nominating power. It reflects, rather, the wisdom of executive consultation with senators who, after all, would have the authority to confirm or reject presidential nominees.

When President Washington nominated Benjamin Fishbourn to be naval officer for the port of Savannah, Georgia, the two senators from that state objected, and the Senate rejected Fishbourn’s appointment. The episode set a precedent: approval by the senators of a state was necessary when a nominee’s work would occur in that state. Otherwise, the Senate would reject the presidential nomination. In time, this practice became known as senatorial courtesy. These courtesies usually extend to cases where local interests prevail, so that the president is yielding to those local interests. With the emergence of political parties, though, that courtesy extended only to senators of the president’s party. President Theodore Roosevelt acknowledged the influence of the Senate: “The Senators and Congressmen shall ordinarily name the man, but I shall name the standard; and the men have to come up to it.” The influence proved to be sweeping, as the decades passed. When Senator John Warner presented three names to the Bush Administration in 1989 for a vacant federal judgeship in Virginia’s Western District, plus two names for a vacancy in the Eastern District, a newspaper headline declared: “Warner nominates 5 for judgeships.” The appointment power seems to have been turned on its head. The reversal of roles—senatorial nomination and presidential consent—marked a changing trajectory. Presidents might reject senatorial recommendations, and ask for names more acceptable, but the Senate had asserted a lead, rather than a secondary, role.

Brandeis was approved by the Senate, but only after a nine-month trial by fire; Bork was defeated only after four months of what, at times, was a brutal process. Both faced stern ideological opposition, and political concerns were expressed with bare knuckles. For some in the Senate, Brandeis was too far to the Left; for others, Bork was too far to the Right. As the first Jewish nominee for a seat on the Court, Brandeis also was the victim of widespread anti-antisemitism.

Without the Recess Appointments Clause, important governmental functions and responsibilities would have been hamstrung or ground to a halt.

Did it mean, literally, vacancies that may occur during a recess? Or did it mean that the president might fill vacancies that occurred while the Senate was in session? President George Washington took a narrow view of the clause and made recess appointments only when they occurred during a Senate recess. Washington’s successors have employed a broader understanding of the clause. Since the presidency of James Madison, most presidents have adopted a more expansive view and, despite Senate opposition to such interpretation, in using recess appointments to fill any existing vacancy, including those that occurred while the Senate was in session. A long list of opinions issued by Attorneys General has embraced the Madisonian position. In 1823, for example, Attorney General Wirt concluded that the broader version of the clause satisfied the reason, spirit, and purpose of the Constitution, which was to keep offices filled.

Before congressional sessions were lengthened, for example, presidents often exerted political advantage in the use of recess appointments and would sometimes wait until Congress had adjourned before filling a vacancy. When the Senate returned from recess, the president submitted the name of the appointee for confirmation. The fact that the appointee had been on the job for many months, accumulating valuable experience and expertise, made it difficult for the Senate to reject the nomination. Observers of the process concluded that frequent use of recess appointments was strategic, a means of circumventing the confirmation process. The Senate, fearing the loss of its advice and consent role retaliated by persuading Congress to pass statutes denying a salary to those recess appointees named to posts that had become vacant while the Senate was in session and able to approve or reject the nominee.  Recess appointments of federal judges have presented a special concern because they raise the possibility of litigants facing a judge who does not have a lifetime appointment and who will soon be reviewed for confirmation by the Senate. The virtues of judicial impartiality, integrity, and objectivity may be more difficult to satisfy under those circumstances, but federal courts have upheld presidential authority to make recess appointments to the bench.

While President Obama declined to assert his authority, despite the public statements of GOP senators that they would not hold hearings on the nomination of Garland, he would have been supported by historical practice. There have been 15 recess appointments to the Supreme Court, including the most recent, Potter Stewart, appointed by President Eisenhower in 1959. Of the 15, only five actually participated in the work before winning Senate confirmation. Of the five who did assume a seat on the High Bench before confirmation, four were later confirmed by the Senate and one, John Rutledge, nominated in 1795 by President Washington, was denied confirmation by the Senate.   President Obama’s reluctance to make Chief Judge Garland the first recess appointment to the Court in more than four decades, probably was influenced by a 1960 Senate resolution—a year after Eisenhower’s appointment of Stewart—introduced by Sen. Philip A. Hart (D-MI), which stated that recess appointments to the Court should not be made except under “unusual circumstances and for the purpose of preventing or ending a demonstrable breakdown in the administration of the Court’s business.” While the Hart Resolution is not binding, presidents since its passage have refrained from making recess appointments to the Court.

The debate, conducted by the First Congress, virtually an ongoing session of the Constitutional Convention because so many of its members were delegates in Philadelphia, runs some 200 pages in the legislative record. Madison initiated the exploration of the removal power with a proposal to create three executive departments: Foreign Affairs, Treasury, and War. Each department head would be appointed by the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and “removable by the President.” William Smith of South Carolina objected to giving the president the sole power of removal. In reply, Madison articulated what became the chief rationale for an executive removal power: the president would be made more accountable when vested with the authority to remove officials who were engaged in the enforcement of the laws. Indeed, Madison asked, ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_161","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_161","title":"how can the president be held to the duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” if he could not remove those who would thwart performance of his constitutional responsibilities? The rationale became all the more comprehensible, indeed, more forceful, later in the Convention when the Framers, engaged in a discussion about impeachment, agreed that the failure to “faithfully” execute the laws would warrant impeachment. Theodorick Bland wanted the removal power shared with the Senate to make it consistent with the appointment process, but the House rejected his motion.  Madison’s rationale proved persuasive to his colleagues in the House, but the decision was a difficult one. Members wondered whether the proposal to vest the president with the removal power would concentrate too much authority in the office. In the Senate, for example, Vice President John Adams broke a tie vote to preserve the president’s removal power. Votes on executive removal of the other department heads were just as close, including a 9 to 10 vote on a motion to deny the president’s power to remove the Secretary of War. Following Madison’s approach, the legislation creating the departments of Foreign Affairs, War, and Treasury acknowledged the removal power of the president: subordinate officers would assume charge and custody of all records whenever the secretary “shall be removed from office by the President of the United States.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_110","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_110","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22782","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22807","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_111","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_111","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22861","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22886","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide17132","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The “Decision of 1789”","thumbnail":"dr/Slide17132_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si17261","Text_Caption_160","Text_Caption_161","btn_previous_110","si22782","si22807","btn_next_111","si22861","si22886"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide17132"}}},{"id":"si17324","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si17326","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_53","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_53","title":"Presidential Appointments ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_130","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_130","roles":{}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_40","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_40","title":"Early Removals ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_162","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_162","title":"Resignations and Terminations ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_163","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_163","title":"From the beginning, presidents exercised their authority to remove officials.

In a move that reignited old partisan fires, and led to a landmark ruling, United States v. Smith (1806), Thomas Jefferson actually removed John Adams’ son-in-law, Col. William Smith, surveyor of the port of New York, for taking part in a plot against Spanish possessions in South America, a violation of U.S. law. In the Smith case, Col. Smith had falsely claimed that President Jefferson had authorized his military expedition. Justice William Paterson, a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, was riding circuit and presided over the case. He said that even if the president had authorized the military hostilities, such orders were legally and constitutionally insufficient, since only Congress may authorize the initiation of military action and, in any case, the expedition violated the U.S. Neutrality Act. Jefferson was active in removing officials during his to terms in office. His removal of 109 officers included Adams’ midnight judges at the end of his term, and several lawyers and collectors of customs. James Madison fired his Secretary of State, Robert Smith, for incompetence, stating that whatever talents Smith had, he did not “possess those adapted to his station.” During the War of 1812, President Madison also obtained, under pressure, the resignation of Gen. John Armstrong as Secretary of War, after Armstrong had failed to prepare the capital against the arrival of British troops and Washington was occupied and sacked. All told, Madison removed 27 officials, most of them customs collectors. James Monroe also removed 27 officials. One-third of them were from the foreign service and one-third collectors of revenue.

As president, Jackson established the principle of rotation in office on partisan grounds, a policy famously portrayed in his slogan, “to the victor belongs the spoils.” It has been calculated that fewer than one-tenth of the lower ranking officials were removed by Jackson, belying the proposition that he engaged in wholesale removals of officers. Jackson’s removal of Secretary Duane placed him on a collision course with Congress.

Jealous of its power, the Senate, in 1834, censured Jackson for the removal of Duane. The Whig-dominated Senate Resolution concluded that Jackson had “assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the Constitution and laws, but in derogation of both.” Jackson replied, forcefully, that he possessed the authority of “removing those officers who are in aid to him in the execution of the laws.” Three years later, the Senate, with a different partisan set of characters, expunged the censure resolution from its record. Jackson resented the legislative punishment for the rest of his life.  But the story of retaliation continued. After removing Duane, President Jackson appointed Roger B. Taney during a recess appointment, and Taney implemented Jackson’s bank policy. When it reconvened, the Senate retaliated by blocking Taney’s appointment as Secretary of Treasury, forcing him to give up his post. Making matters worse—for Taney—the Senate then rejected his nomination for a seat on the Supreme Court. In 1836, a reconfigured Senate, not only expunged the censure, but also approved Jackson’s re-nomination of Taney to the High Court.

On the same day, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, one of the most visible and contentious statutes passed by Congress in the history of American politics.

Both the Command of the Army Act and the Tenure of Office Act were passed over Johnson’s veto.  Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was at odds with Johnson, and proved to be a disruptive voice in Johnson’s Cabinet. Johnson had hoped Stanton would resign over their policy differences, but he refused. Johnson then suspended Stanton, but the Senate refused to support the president. As a consequence, Johnson proceeded to remove Stanton from the cabinet, with the hope that the constitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act would be reviewed in court and that he would prevail. There was no litigation on the matter, as Johnson had hoped. As it happened, Ulysses S. Grant, installed by President Johnson as the interim Secretary of War, and Grant’s successor, permitted Stanton to regain his office. Johnson’s violation of the Tenure of Office Act, led the House of Representatives to impeach him.  In the Senate trial, Johnson escaped removal by just one vote.

But Taft swept too broadly, and committed historiographical errors, in assigning an exclusive power of removal to the president. Madison, in the course of the Decision of 1789, had been persuasive in arguing that the president’s removal power was limited to those involved in enforcing laws. Manifestly, not all officials are engaged in the enforcement of laws—an oversight that undercuts Taft’s assertion of an exclusive presidential power of removal. Taft erred, as well, in his claim that the Decision of 1789 involved the removal of all executive officials. That debate, however, was limited to the removal of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Madison, moreover, had argued that some officials, including the Comptroller of the Treasury, possessed quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial duties, and that their tenure could thus be protected by Congress. Madison’s reasoning about congressional control of the removal of officials with duties reflective of a mixture of legislative and judicial duties, would be embraced by the Supreme Court a decade later in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States (1935).

Holmes, in a three-paragraph dissent, pointed out that Congress had the power to create offices, and to abolish them, as well as the authority to establish terms of office and salaries, and shape the department’s conditions and regulations through legislation. Holmes said Taft’s arguments were “ a spider’s webs, inadequate to control the dominant facts.” Brandeis, in a 41-page dissent, studded with rich footnotes, described how Congress had often fixed the tenure of inferior offices and limited the president’s removal power. McReynolds noted that Congress had passed many statutes “vigorously” asserting “its right to restrict removals.” He added, powerfully, that there had been “no common executive practice based on a contrary view,” and called Taft’s assertion of an exclusive presidential power of removal “revolutionary.”  Taft’s overreach in Myers was scaled back by the Court in Humphrey’s Executor, in which the Court held that Congress does have the power to limit the president’s removal power over commissioners with quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative powers. Humphrey’s decision thus protected the independence of regulatory agencies. In Wiener v. United States (1958), the Court went further and emphasized that such officials are insulated from arbitrary removal, even in the absence of a statutory provision governing their tenure in office. Subsequent judicial decisions have held that the removal of subordinates must adhere to agency procedures of due process.
